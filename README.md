# AI-Investment-Advisor-Capstone
To run the project,
Put the dash and copilot files in same folder. In that folder, create a subfolder called assets and place the javascript file there. 
In your terminal (vs code), make sure you're in the working directory. Run the dash app this way `python3 cmu-dash.py`
Run the copilot this way: `python3 -m chainlit run chat-hypo-pilot.py -w -h`
Note: both must be running. You can do that by creatingh two terminal sessions - one for each.
