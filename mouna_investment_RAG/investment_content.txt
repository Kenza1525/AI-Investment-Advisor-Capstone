What are Shares?​
Overview
Once you have decided that you are interested in buying shares, it is important to have a clear understanding of the act of investing and the different shares available to trade with.​
​
By the time you have completed this module, you should be able to answer the following questing:​

What are shares?​
What basics do I need to know before I invest?​
What are types of shares that you can invest in?


What Basics Do I Need to Know Before I Invest?
You will come across some unfamiliar terms as you begin your investment journey. Below are some basic terms to familiarize yourself with as you get started:

Dividends​
Returns​
Shares/Equities​
Supply & Demand


What are Shares?
A share is simply proof of ownership of part of a company. The more shares you have, the more of the company you own, and you become known as a shareholder. This proof of ownership is represented by a share certificate, which today, is recorded electronically. ​
​
As a shareholder, it means that you have access to your share of the company’s earnings and any voting rights attached to the shares. It is important to note that being a shareholder does not necessarily mean you have a say in the day-to-day running of the business or that you can take items from the company where you hold shares (e.g. free clothing from Woolworths).​
​
Companies sell shares so that they can raise the money needed to grow and expand their business, and to carry out certain projects to generate more income. These companies can sell shares either publicly or privately, and you can buy different types of shares.

Types of Shares to Invest In
Ordinary Shares​
​
These are shares that a business issues (sells) so as to raise capital (funds) for the business.​
​
Benefits/Positives: Owners of ordinary shares essentially own the business as they are able to vote and manage the company. They have a share in the performance of the company. These shares can get you higher capital returns compared to bonds.​
​
Risks/Negatives: The future capital value of ordinary shares is not guaranteed so these shares carry a higher risk than bonds.

Types of Shares to Invest In
Preference Shares​
These shares are considered to be a combination of debt and equity because they pay a fixed dividend (like how you pay interest on debt), yet they can also give the shareholder capital growth potential (just as ordinary shares do). They are considered to be somewhere between bonds and ordinary shares.​
​
Benefits/Positives: Preference shares can also get you higher capital returns (return on the money you invest) compared to bonds.​
​
Risks/Negatives: These shares do not give shareholders any voting rights (much like debt).
 
Exchange Traded Funds​
An ETF is simply an acronym for Exchange Traded Funds. These funds aim to mimic the performance of a certain index. Therefore, it becomes easier and cheaper to have an investment portfolio that mimics the performance of a particular share index. ​
Rather than buying shares of all the companies that make up an index, an investor can simply buy the ETF that copies the performance of the index. Before ETF’s were available investors who were looking to create an investment portfolio that behaved very similarly to the FTSE/JSE All Share index had to buy over 150 shares. ​
Therefore, ETF’s are considered to be well diversified investment products and are great for first time investors looking for low risk portfolios that require little management. Holding a portfolio that mimics the behaviour of a market index no longer requires an active strategy burdened with the fees of regular buying and selling of shares. ETF’s may also provide income in the form of dividends if any of the underlying companies do declare one, however this is not true for all ETF’s.​
An example of an ETF is the Satrix 40 which aims to accurately replicate the FTSE/JSE Top 40 index, by holding the exact weighting and number of shares that constitute JSE top 40 index. Investors who buy ETF’s may also receive dividends, some paying on a quarterly basis. Therefore, investors can earn capital gains and dividend rewards. The greatest advantage of buying an ETF such as the SATRIX 40 is that just one share or ETF unit represents the Top 40 shares.




Why Invest in Shares?​
Overview
We have taken the time to understand our current financial situation which will help us make wise decisions about our future investment goals. It is time to understand why buying shares is a good method of investing and growing your money as part of the wealth creation process​.
​
By the time you have completed this module, you should be able to answer the following:​

Why should I invest in shares?​
What is capital growth?​
What are dividends?


Why Invest in Shares?
Shares are a tool to generate more income for the future. Most investors, even those who are conservative, want some level of income generation from their portfolio. You can choose to invest in shares so that you make the most of your current income for future goals such as:​

Sending children to college​
Buying a house or car​
Making sure you have money for your retirement​
Starting a business​
Creating a fund for emergencies​

So what does the income made from investing in shares look like? The income made from investing in shares comes in 2 forms:​

Capital Growth ​
Dividends​

​
If you invested R1000 in shares and the share price was R100 a share, and the price of the shares goes up to R110, you would have received an increase in value of your shares of 10%. However, if the share price went down to R90, your shares would have decreased in value by 10%.* It is important to remember that investing in shares does not guarantee income/profits as it all depends on what the share price will be when you sell.​
*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples

Capital Growth
Simply put, capital growth is the difference between the amount you paid for your share and its current value. So, if you bought a share a year ago and paid R100 for it and today this same share had gone up in value to R150, the capital growth would be valued at R50.*
You are able to determine whether you have made a profit or a loss on your investment by subtracting the price you paid for your share from the sale price at which you sold it. In the above example, you would have made a R50 profit.​
​
A profitable trade is one where you buy a share at a lower price than what you sell it at. When you buy shares, a profit is only made when you sell the shares at a higher selling price.​
​
*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples
You are also able to calculate the percentage return of your shares by dividing the profit or loss you make at the sale of your shares by the initial price you bought it for.
From our previous example, that would look like:​
R50 / R100 x 100 = 50%*​
​
If you owned five of these shares, then this 50% return would mean that you made a profit/ income of R250, calculated as follows:
*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples

Dividends
Dividends are how a company rewards or pays out a portion of its profits to shareholders/ investors. It is important to note that not all companies pay dividends, even if they are profitable. They can choose to do several things with the profit made such as:​

Re-invest it into their business​
Pay off debt ​
Pay a portion of these profits to their shareholders (i.e. dividends)​

​
Companies pay out dividends either once or twice a year, should they pay it out, after their annual or interim results. It is the company board's discretion whether to pay out dividends to shareholders and how much to pay in dividends. For instance, if I invested R1000 at R10 each with 100 shares, it pays out 20c per dividend and I would get R20.*​
​
*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples




What are Dividends?​
Overview
This module will take a look at what dividends are and the different ways in which companies pay these out.​
​
As you invest in shares, it is important for you to understand how much you may get paid from these as well as whether the company has a good long-term strategy based on how they distribute their profits to shareholders (including you).​
​
Receiving a dividend is one way of gaining an income from your share investment.
 
Defining Dividends

​
*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples

How Much Will I Get Paid?
If a dividend is declared, the amount you would receive depends on the number of shares you hold because all dividends are paid on a “per share basis”. ​
​
Remember, companies can choose the level to pay, which can be anything from, more than the years' profit, (as long as they have accumulated and retained previous years’ profit), or it could be nothing at all.​
​
Dividend Pay-Out Ratio​
This is the percentage of net income paid out in the form of dividends:​
​

Dividend pay-out ratio = (gross dividend payment)/(net income)​

​
Despite the obvious desire to receive more of a payout in dividends, wise investors often prefer to see this ratio at a level less than 70% because then they know that earnings are going back into growing the business. Often when a company is in a development phase, dividend pay-out can drop all the way to zero in order to use available cash flow to fund projects. So don't automatically write off shares that pay no dividend income either.
 
Dividend Yield​
The dividend yield is the percentage of net income to be paid out as cash dividends to shareholders. ​
​

Dividend yield=(Annual dividends per share)/(Price per share)​

​
The company decides on the dividend yield based upon its preferences, which are either to distribute income as cash dividends or to re-invest the income back into the company to generate further income.​
​
As a shareholder who has purchased shares in a company, the dividend yield may be very important to you when considering purchasing a share. A high yield indicates that you will obtain a high revenue from the share. ​
​
A high dividend yield may not necessarily mean that your share value is made the most of, because companies that retain their earnings and pay low or no dividends may use those reserved earnings to grow and build the company and therefore grow your investment, which means you have a capital gain.​
​
Obviously the ideal situation is to own a share that gives you both income and a good capital growth.

Important Dividend Dates
There are three important dates relating to dividends:​
​
1) Date of declaration – this is the date on which the dividend is declared by the​
company.​
​
2) Last Day of Trade (LDT) – Only shareholders owning this share on this date will receive the dividends. You may sell the shares after this date and still receive the dividends.​
​
3) Date of payment – This is the date of payment of the dividend. Dividends are​
only paid to shareholders registered on the date of record.




What are Derivatives?​
Overview
In this module we are going to uncover derivatives and understand what these tools are and why people make use of them.​
​
Understanding derivatives will provide you with a foundation to grasp futures and options which will be expanded on in separate modules.

Defining Derivatives
A derivative can be summed up as a tradable instrument in its own right. In other words, something you can buy or sell on its own, the price of which is tied to some other underlying reference instrument or security. Common underlying instruments include currencies, bonds, commodities, interest rates, market indices, and shares. ​
​
Derivatives form part of advanced investing. Essentially, a derivative is a secondary security whose value is only based (derived) on the value of the main security that it is linked to. Having a derivative gives you access to the main asset without actually owning it. Futures contracts, forward contracts, and options are commonly used derivatives.​
​
A futures contract, for example, is affected by the performance of the underlying asset and is therefore a derivative. In the same way, a share option is a derivative because its value is as a result of the underlying share. As mentioned above, while a derivative's value is based on an asset, owning a derivative doesn't mean you own the asset.

Functions of Derivatives
Derivatives are very efficient tools used by market participants to manage their risk or as a way in which to obtain a desired exposure in the actual underlying instrument or market. ​
​
The two main functions of derivatives are: ​

Risk Management – Using derivatives to protect against possible hostile market movements. ​
Trading – Using derivatives to express a directional trade or exposure via the use of leverage.​

The concept of “the price being tied to some underlying security” will also be explained in more detail below. 
Let’s look at an example of how derivatives are used to lessen risk: ​
A German beer garden expects a nice hot week ahead. They are also quite familiar with how many pints of beer are consumed when the weather is nice and hot. ​
Looking at the expected forecast they are set to sell around 1,000 pints of beer. 
However, the owner of the beer garden is also aware of the risk they face should temperatures not be as high as originally expected. He is far too familiar with the fact that when it is wet and cold, people tend to stay inside and drink hot beverages like coffee or tea, and will not want to come out to his beer garden for beers. 
As it turned out, the following week was one of the coldest summer weeks in history. ​
As one can imagine, selling only 357 pints of beer, when the business was banking on selling 1,000 is a big problem for the owner. ​
To manage this risk of lower sales should the temperature be less than the average expected, the beer garden owner entered into a weather derivative contract where for every degree the actual temperature falls below the average expected temperature, the derivative contract will compensate the beer garden owner with a pre-determined cash payment. 
In summary, even though the beer garden owner had lower sales, the weather derivative kicked in a cash payment on all the days where the temperature fell below the expected temperature, and in doing so increased the overall income received over this period, resulting in the beer garden owner staying in business. 
​
It is evident then that due to the existence of derivatives the beer garden owner was able to indeed lessen the risk and ensure that the business remains viable. 
​
What is also evident in this example is the fact that the “price” i.e. the pay-out on the part of the derivative, was based upon something else. In our example it was temperature. In other words, the weather derivative’s price was based upon another underlying instrument (in this case the actual temperature). ​
If the market for derivatives did not exist, can you begin to imagine how difficult it would be for this business owner to mitigate this risk? Once again, the availability of derivatives allows for a very efficient risk management process. Arguably a significant benefit exists for the owner to manage risk inherent in his business. 




What are Options?​
Overview
This is a brief module to familiarize you with options. Options are a class of derivatives.​
​
We will delve into the definition of an option as well as the two different types of options available. We will also briefly consider how options work in terms of investing.

Defining Options
In order to best understand what options are, let’s take a moment to consider car insurance as they follow similar principles.​
Car insurance isn’t there to protect the car itself from accidents, but rather it ensures that in the event of any damage to the car, the policy will cover the damages. The damages is also not just covered by merely receiving a fixed pay-out amount from the policy. ​
Instead, the policy will pay the value needed depending on the damage. In other words, if the damage is only R15,000 the policy will pay out R15,000, if the damage is R100,000 the insurance policy will pay out that amount. ​
In essence the pay-out of the policy is in relation to how much the car is damaged when compared to what the car originally looks like. The more the damage, the higher the pay-out. ​
In addition, one does not get car insurance for free. In order to have car insurance one has to settle a premium, in most cases monthly. We can sum this insurance process up by stating that, by paying one month’s premium, one effectively buys “protection” and that the period this protection is valid for is one month. ​
Another premium is due for the insurance to extend into the following month. If you don’t pay the premium due, there will be no cover. ​
Simply put, if your car insurance stopped on the 31st of the month, and you did not renew it, then if the car gets stolen or damaged the very next day, you will not be protected at all. Or looked at from a different angle, the policy “does not care” what happens after the expiration date of the policy as the insurance company is no longer on the hook from then onwards.
Options and Car Insurance are not that different after all: ​
When it comes to options, the traditional car insurance model takes on the form of a financial contract that allows protection against possible damages caused by the market moving against your position. ​
Similar to car insurance, this financial insurance policy (the option) also requires you to pay a premium, and this only covers your position for a certain, pre-determined time. If you need new insurance after that point, you once again need to pay a premium. ​
The financial insurance also does not pay out at random. Much like the car insurance, the financial insurance will look at where the current market is trading (i.e. damage) in relation to the protection level originally agreed on (i.e. what your car usually looks like). ​
In the end, the financial policy or option will be worth the difference between the damage and normal much the same as the car insurance offered us, allowing for a choice of two outcomes: ​

a) Either get the car replaced, or when speaking in financial terms, transacting in the underlying instrument at the options contract strike rate. ​
b) Get a cash pay out to fix the car i.e. a cash pay-out received on a financial contract that compensates for the difference between the prevailing spot rate and the option’s contract rate. ​

When looked at from this point of view, one can agree that as far as vanilla options* go, their function and use are indeed not that difficult to grasp. ​
*Vanilla option is a plain/ordinary option with no special features

Call Options
A call option provides the buyer of the option with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying instrument on which the call option is taken out (i.e. written).​
Call options are available on numerous types of securities such as:​
• Currencies​
• Shares​
• Commodities​
• Interest Rates​
​
Regardless of the underlying instrument, a Call option will always retain its own core underlying characteristics, in other words, the buyer of the call option has the right to purchase the underlying instrument.​
It is important to understand the concept that a call option is an instrument in its own right. In other words, a Call option itself, even though it is a “purchase contract on something”, can be bought or sold.
As can be seen, the benefit of a call option is that it allows for full protection should the market move against the option, yet still allowing the flexibility to walk away from the option and let it expire in the event of the market price being lower than that of the strike rate on the option. i.e. when the end result is not favourable for the investor.

Put Options
A Put option provides the buyer of the option with the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying instrument on which the put option is written on. ​
As with Call options, Put options are also available on all the same types of securities highlighted earlier, and one can safely assume that if there is a market for the Call options on any particular instrument, then there will also be a market for Put options. Call and Put options fall under a general category often referred to as Vanilla Options.​
This basically implies that there are no frills or special conditions that exist around these options other than a few basic varieties. In the end though, Vanilla options provide a very basic core function, that of providing a fixed rate of conversion which the buyer may choose to use or not.​
Back to Put options, regardless on the underlying instrument, a put option will always retain its own core underlying characteristic of providing the buyer of the put option the right to sell the underlying instrument.​
As highlighted before but worth repeating, a put option is an instrument in its own right. In other words, the Put option itself, even though it is a “contract to sell something”, can be bought or sold.
The benefit of a Put option lies in the fact that it allows for full protection should the market move against the option, yet still allowing the flexibility to walk away from the option, and let it expire, in the event of the market price being higher than that of the strike rate on the option.​
*The strike price for buying or selling the security until the expiration date.

Investing Using Options
Options are very versatile in their application, and in order to understand how they are used, as part of a trading or investing strategy we need to first explore the various motives one would have to use them. ​
Though, regardless of the motive being trading or hedging the final outcome one would look to achieve from options lies as a combination of the following: ​

Enhancement of an existing process and/or ​
Participation in favourable market movements ​

​
Options are a flexible investment product. These investments are two-sided trades involving a buyer and a seller. Each call option has a bullish buyer (believes shares will go up) and a bearish seller (believes shares will go down), while put options have a bearish buyer and a bullish seller. ​
​
Options contracts are typically represented by 100 shares of the basic security, and the buyer pays a premium fee for each contract. For instance, if an option has a premium of R5 per contract, buying one option would cost R500 (R5 x 100 = R500).​
​
The strike price somewhat forms the basis of the premium —the strike price is the price for buying or selling the security until the date of expiration. The premium price is also influenced by the expiration date. In the same way that milk has an expiration date, the expiration date for options shows the day the option contract must be used by. The underlying asset will decide the use-by date.




What is Interest?
Overview
Interest is not earned by holding a share but you do receive interest depending on what type of account you have on the cash balance of your investment.​
This module will help to answer questions around the topic of interest in finance.​

Simple vs Compound Interest
Interest is the cost of borrowing money, where the borrower pays a fee to the lender for using the latter's money. ​
​
There are two ways in which interest can be calculated, simple interest or compound interest.​
​

Simple interest is worked out on the principal, or original, amount of a loan.​
Compound interest is calculated on the principal (original) amount and also on the added interest of previous periods, and so can be seen as “interest on interest.”​

​
There can be a vast difference in the amount of interest to be paid on a loan if interest is calculated on a compound rather than simple basis. On the upside, the magic of compounding can be advantageous to you when it comes to your investments and can be a potent factor in wealth creation.​
​
Although simple and compound interest are basic financial concepts, it may be of assistance to you to become fully familiar with them in order to make informed decisions when taking out a loan or investing.

Simple Interest Formula
The formula for calculating simple interest is:​
​
Simple interest = P x i x n ​
where:​
P = Principle​
i = interest rate ​
n = term of the loan​
​   ​
As a result, if simple interest is charged at 5% on a R10,000 loan that is taken out for three years, the total amount of interest payable by the borrower is calculated as:​
​
 R10,000 x 0.05 x 3 = R1,500.​
​
Interest on this loan is payable at R500 per year, or R1,500 over the three-year loan term.
 
Compound Interest Formula
The method used to calculate compound interest in a year is:​
Compound interest = [P(1+i)ⁿ] − P​
Compound interest = P[(1+i)ⁿ − 1]​
where:​
P = Principle​
i = interest rate in percentage terms​
n = number of compounding periods for one year​
​  ​
﻿Compound Interest = Total amount of Principal and Interest in the future (or Future Value) less the Principal amount at present called Present Value (PV). PV is the present worth of a future amount of money or stream of cash flows given a definite rate of return. Carrying on with the simple interest example, what would the interest amount be if it is charged on a compound basis? In this case, it would be:​
​
R10,000 [(1 + 0.05)³ – 1] = R10,000 [1.157625 – 1] = R1,576.25​
​
While the total interest payable over the 3-year period of this loan is R1,576.25, unlike simple interest, the interest amount is not the same for all 3 years because compound interest also takes into consideration collected interest of previous periods.
 
Time Value of Money
Time value of money is the financial term to describe how money can earn interest or grow over time. No matter who you are, "cash is king" and money now is worth more than money received later because it can earn you interest over time. ​
​
In simple terms, compounding is about earning something, like a dividend, and then reinvesting this income which will then also earn income and then reinvesting this income too. ​
​
Thus, the process continues into great returns and your money starts working even harder for you. The key point to bear in mind here is the long term focus, as this is where it starts to show up in its exponential form.​
​
It is important to note that interest is not earned when buying shares. You can earn interest on the cash balance sitting in your broker account, depending on whom you have an account with. 




What are Bonds?
Overview
This module aims to offer deeper insights into bonds as a form of investment. It will take a look at:​

Defining Bonds​
Bonds vs Bank Loans​
Bonds vs Shares​
Why Should I Invest in Bonds?


Defining Bonds
When the need arises to raise money, issuing bonds is one of the ways that companies do this. As a product, a bond gives something for investors to invest in, and by doing so provides the company with the funding it requires.​
​
The investor concurs to give the business a precise amount of money for a specific timeframe in exchange for broken up interest payments at chosen intervals. The investor’s loan is then paid back when the loan reaches its maturity date.​
​
The choice to issue bonds rather than selecting other methods of raising money can be motivated by many factors. ​
​
Comparing the characteristics and advantages of bonds versus other common ways of raising cash offers some insight into why companies usually look to issuing bonds when they need to raise cash to fund corporate activities.

Bonds vs Bank Loans
Borrowing from a bank is possibly the approach that many people think of first when they need money. Therefore, the question would then be asked, “Why would a business issue bonds as an alternative to borrowing from a bank?”​
​
Like people, companies can borrow from banks, but issuing bonds is often more attractive. The interest rate businesses pay bond investors is frequently less than the interest rate they would need to pay to get a bank loan. ​
​
Since the money paid out in interest reduces corporate profits and companies are in business to generate profits, decreasing the interest amount that must be paid to borrow money is an important consideration. This is why a company would issue bonds.​
​
Issuing bonds also gives companies considerably greater freedom to operate as they see fit because it releases them from the restrictions that are often attached to bank loans. Consider, for example, that companies are regularly required to agree to a variety of limitations by lenders, such as refraining from issuing more debt or not making corporate acquisitions until their loans are fully paid off.​
​
Limitations such as these can hinder a company’s ability to do business and limit its operational options, and issuing bonds allows companies to raise money with no such strings attached.

Bonds vs Shares
Issuing shares, which means giving proportional ownership in the company to investors in exchange for money, is a popular way for corporations to raise money. From a corporate perspective, perhaps the most attractive feature of issuing shares is that the money generated from the sale of shares does not need to be repaid. ​
​
There are, however, downsides to issuing shares that may make bonds the more attractive option. In terms of bonds, companies that want to raise money can keep on issuing new bonds as long as they are able to find investors willing to act as lenders. This act of issuing new bonds has no impact on ownership of the company or how it is operated. ​
​
Share issuance, on the other hand, puts extra shares in circulation. This means that future earnings must be shared between a larger pool of investors. The consequence of this can be a decline in earnings per share (EPS), meaning the owners’ have less money in their pockets.​
​
EPS is also one of the measurements that investors look at when calculating a firm’s health. A declining EPS number is generally not seen as a positive development.​
​
Issuing additional shares also means that ownership is now dispersed across a greater number of investors, which usually makes each owner’s share worth less money. Since investors buy shares to make money, diluting the value of their investments is not a favorable outcome. By issuing bonds, companies can avoid this outcome.

Why Should I Invest in Bonds?
There are many reasons why anyone would consider investing in bonds. As an asset class bonds are considered as interest bearing instruments. The concept behind a bond is that you make an investment in exchange for a known and frequent receipt of an interest payment.​
​
The known interest payment is very attractive in that it is an investment which gives you annuity income. Consider the importance of knowing when and how much interest is due, in the eyes of someone who has retired and is banking on knowing exactly when and how much they will receive.​
​
Investing in bonds is, however, not always that straight forward. There are a few other market factors at work which may be harmful to your investment if not understood or accounted for. When considering investing in bonds it is important to consider the following:​
​
• Understand that bonds are not the same as money market deposits. Bonds do not necessarily protect your invested funds the way money markets can.​
• Bonds are “IOU’s” issued by companies, and as such what really happens is the company now owes you money, and in return for lending the funds to them, you will earn a coupon (interest). The more risky the investment, the higher the return needs to be.​
• The financial soundness of the bond issuer.​
• Your own investment horizon. If you do not intend to hold a bond to maturity, your investment will be exposed to more risks. In the same breath, you want to avoid being forced to liquidate a bond position.​
• What is the true underlying motive: investing or trading?




Types of Bonds​
Overview
You were introduced to bonds in a previous module and got to understand what a bond is and why you should invest in bonds.​
​
This module will now offer more clarity around the categories of bonds that you can invest in as well as the characteristics of bonds.

Categories of Bonds
There are four main categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also find foreign bonds issued by firms and governments on some platforms.​
​
1. Corporate bonds are issued by companies. Companies issue bonds to raise funds for large scale projects rather than getting bank loans for them because, in many cases, the bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.​
2. Government bonds are bonds issued by government entities and list them on the JSE Debt Board to raise funds for large scale projects such as roads, hospitals, and power stations. The types of bonds issued can vary, e.g. Vanilla Bonds, Variable Bonds, CPI Bonds and Zero Coupon bonds. ​
3. Repo bonds. The full name for a Repo is “repurchase agreement” and can also be known as a sale and repurchase agreement or RP. This type of bond involves the sale of securities with the agreement that the original seller will eventually buy their securities back from the original  buyer, usually at a higher price than what they were originally sold for. ​
4. Green bonds allows investors access to the investment potential of green technologies, services, and infrastructure. Green Bonds are used to raise funds for new or existing green projects that have a positive climate/ environmental benefit.

The Characteristics of Bonds
Most bonds share some common basic characteristics including:​
​
Face value is the amount of money that the bond will be valued at at maturity; it is also what the bond issuer uses as the reference amount when calculating interest payments. For example, say an investor purchases a bond at a premium R10,090 and another investor buys the same bond later when it is trading at a discount for R9,800. When the bond matures, both investors will receive the R10,000 face value of the bond.​
​
The coupon rate is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, stated as a percentage. For example, a 5% coupon rate means that bondholders will receive 5% x R10 000 face value = R500 every year.​
​
Coupon dates are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments, which can be made in any interval.​
​
The date on which the bond matures is known as the maturity date and it is when the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.​
​
The price at which the issuer of the bond originally sells the bonds is known as the issue price.
 
Varieties of Bonds
The bonds accessible to investors come in numerous different forms. They can be separated by the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, to be paid by the issuer, or have other attributes.​
​
Zero-coupon bonds do not pay coupon payments and as an alternative are issued at a markdown to their par value that will produce a return once the bondholder is paid the full-face value when the bond matures. ​
​
Convertible bonds are debt tools with a set-in option that lets bondholders transform their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on particular conditions like the share price.​
​
Callable bonds also have an entrenched option but it is not the same as what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be “called” back by the business before maturity. A callable bond is riskier for the buyer of the bond because the bond is more likely to be called when it is increasing in value.




What are Futures?​
Overview
This is a brief module to familiarize you with forward contracts and futures. ​
​
We will delve into the definition of a forward contract and futures contract. In doing so, we will understand the difference between the two and why investors make use of these derivatives.

Defining Futures
What exactly is a forward contract, and what is a future? Both forwards and futures are contracts between two parties, where one party wishes to buy and the other to sell, a pre-determined amount of a particular security, based upon an agreed transaction rate, for delivery at some future date in time.​
Though both types of contracts are exactly similar in that they each provide a guaranteed rate at which to transact in the future, what sets futures and forwards apart is that they are traded via different markets. This by implication often also results in different types of market participants trading in each.​
Though, most importantly, when it comes to their functionality there are hardly any differences between forwards and futures, as both are equally effective in fixing a transaction rate for the future.​
Futures, in particular, —also called futures contracts— are a class of derivatives that allow traders to lock in a price of the basic asset or commodity. ​
They are identified by their expiration month. For instance, a December gold futures contract terminates in December. The term futures has a tendency of representing the general market. Nevertheless, there are countless types of futures contracts offered for trading including:​
​
Commodity futures for instance in wheat, corn, crude oil and natural gas​
Stock index futures such as the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index​
Currency futures ​
Precious metal futures for gold and silver​
​
It's essential to take note of the difference between options and futures. Options contracts provide the holder the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at termination, whereas the futures contract holder is required to comply with the terms of the contract.
A forward trades via a market known as Over The Counter or OTC. This is a market in its bare form. In other words, the participants deal directly with each other and every deal is negotiated on its own merits and unique characteristics. This allows for contracts to be for any particular required amount, done at a specific rate and to a very specific delivery date.​
​
A future on the other hand is a standardised contract which trades and clears via a central exchange, thus referred to as Exchange Traded instruments. ​
​
As a result of the contracts existing on exchange, all contracts are standardised, and uniform in terms of expiration date, quantity per contract, and future expiration dates. This is done in order to improve the ability for the exchange itself to manage the exposures related to each contract more efficiently. ​
​
One important take away is that one of the biggest concerns in trading in the OTC market is the existence of counterparty credit risk (also known as default risk). By using exchange traded contracts one can effectively remove default risk altogether.

Example of a Futures Contract
You bought shares in company XYZ at R120 per share and it is currently trading at R150 per share. You think that the price is going to fall in the coming months due to a downturn in the market. You want to protect the profits you have made from these shares and so you go into a futures contract at a pre-determined price of R160 per share that is actionable upon the expiry of the contract.​
As you predicted, the price falls down to R110 per share at the time of expiry of the contract and you then sell your shares at the pre-determined price of R160 per share, therefore protecting yourself from the drop in share price. 

Futures Listed on the JSE
The JSE offers both Single Stock Futures (SSF) as well as Contracts For Difference (CFDs). Both these styles of futures contracts allow an investor the ability to be exposed to the price movements of an actual underlying share’s price movements. ​
By entering into an SSF or a CFD (i.e. buying or selling the contract), the investor has locked in a rate at which the future transaction will occur, and in doing so now have full exposure to the directional movement of the underlying share price, in relation to the futures contract rate. ​
Given that the calculation of the price of an equity futures contract includes some assumption of possible future dividends, yet to be received during the life of the futures contract, there is a residual risk that exists should the actual dividend differ to what was expected. To counter this risk, the JSE also offers Dividend Futures. ​
A Dividend Futures contract aims to settle the net difference between the actual and expected dividend which was used (implied) in calculating the price of the underlying SSF contract. Note that Dividend Futures are traded in addition to the SSF and is not mandatory, in other words, only those who wish to hedge against the dividend risk will trade Dividend Futures. ​
Single Stock Futures and CFDs are offered on almost all of the Top 40 companies listed on the exchange. ​
In addition to having these contracts available on actual company shares, the JSE also listed a few index futures which enable one to transact over a broader spectrum of shares instead of one single company’s shares.




What are Commodities
Overview
In this module, we will define commodities while also expanding on the types of commodities that are traded.
 
Defining Commodities
We can classify most financial instruments and securities as being part of a general class of intangible financial assets. Financial assets for the most part, are created on exchanges, in the boardrooms, at corporations or in the dealing rooms of banks.​
There is only one category which covers tradable assets created by Mother Nature herself. This category is generally referred to as the Commodities sector.​
In general the global financial markets for commodities are quite liquid, in other words there are a whole host of price makers showing prices on a variety of contracts and dates. This enables easy access for all market participants in order to hedge against or speculate on future price movements of the underlying commodities.​
This is important given that the actual underlying commodities form an integral part in almost everything we consume, see and touch. Let’s consider a few examples:​
The cereal you eat in the morning. The coffee you drink on the way to work. The stuff used to build and run the car you drive, the gold jewelry, the meat and bread you eat, to name a few of the obvious ones.​
Unlike financial assets, a commodity can be summed up as the actual raw material used in production (manufacturing), as well as the products produced from farming activities (such as coffee, orange juice and meat).
 
Types of Commodities
It is quite common for Commodities to be referred to as either “soft” or “hard”, within which there is a further sub-classification along the following lines:​
• Agriculture (Produce, Livestock and Lumber)​
• Energy​
• Metals (Precious Metals & Base/Industrial Metals)​​

Soft Commodities​
To oversimplify a bit, the soft commodity market (also known as softs) in general refers to things related to “farming”. In other words, if it can be grown (wheat) or fed (cattle) then this will be the category in which to find that commodity.​
​
Soft commodities form the basis of all basic food groups. In fact, their use even extends past what we consume directly, but often interlinked with each other. As an example, a price change in grain prices could lead to a price change in cattle prices as many are grain fed.​
​
Price action in the soft commodity market also tends to be a lot more volatile than what is observed in the hard commodities market. The reason being many of the various factors influencing crop yields and quality are all out of the control of the producer for the most part. As such, very little can be done if there is no rain and as a result no crop.
Soft Commodities​
What is interesting though is that commodities have a “convenience charge” attached to it, proving to provide a benefit for those who already own the underlying security. It is not uncommon for the same commodity to have varying prices within a region.​
In other words, if there is a drought in the one area of the country, maize will have to be transported from the area where it is available to the area where it is required. This transport cost has absolutely nothing to do with the underlying supply and demand of the maize, but as one can clearly derive, forms an integral part of the price of maize if it needs to be transported for a sizable distance that exists between the silo and the miller.​
Soft commodities are by far the most sensitive group when you consider all that can go wrong. It can spoil if not used in time, pests can destroy an otherwise healthy crop, and the weather (temperature) can influence the size and quality of the crop. All things that cannot really be controlled or prevented.​
​
The most commonly traded soft commodities are the following:​
​
Agriculture:​
• Maize (Corn) • Soybeans • Wheat • Milk • Cocoa • Cotton • Sugar​
​
Livestock:​
• Hogs • Cattle
 
Hard Commodities​
A hard commodity is the term used to reference the various metals. Within metals there is a general classification between precious and base metals.​
​
Base metals are relatively common and consumed in almost everything that is produced in a factory. In addition, many of the base metals are by-products from the mining activities of other metals, so for the most part fairly common.​
​
Precious metals on the other hand represent those metals which are a little trickier to acquire, and quite often have limited deposits scattered all around the globe. But as a category, one can already comfortably assume that the factors that drive metals are far more “reasonable” than those influencing the softs market, resulting in less volatile prices.​
Metals can’t really spoil, and nor can the weather change the amount of iron ore available in a particular piece of ground. There is no rush to “harvest” metals as the “crop” won’t disappear when the season is over.​
​
Sometimes, events occur which may have some common impact; an example would be severe flooding. It is not uncommon to hear of mines that are so severely flooded that production has to halt for months until the various shafts can be mined again.
 
Hard Commodities​
Hard commodity prices however can also be influenced by something that has very little to do with the availability of the resource. These price fluctuations could also just be momentary or in fact turn out to be structural changes, all of which takes careful consideration of the overall cause and impact of the influencing factor or events.​
​
Labour unrests could make it difficult for a mine to continue operations for a while, but this could be short lived and business as usual may continue a week or so later. So too can port congestions or transport issues be a short-term concern influencing prices.​
​
On the contrary, political instability in a geographic region where most of a particular commodity is sourced from may prevent production or export for a long while. An example of the latter is the conflict in the Middle East and the impact this has on global crude prices.​
​
The most commonly traded metals markets globally are the following:​
Precious Metals:​
• Gold • Platinum • Palladium • Silver​
​
Industrial Metals:​
• Copper • Lead • Zinc • Aluminium
Energy Commodities​
The energy markets are equally popular and liquid. Though one can debate their relative “softness” or “hardness” the point being that this group of commodities are all fundamentally important as part of a vital component of production, consumption and commerce. Oil affects prices of practically everything you can see and touch right before you.​
The use of energy spans all sectors. Raw materials have to be mined by machinery. Raw materials have to be transported from the mines to the factory, humans have to be transported to the factory to go make the goods. Finished goods have to be transported from the factory to the stores selling them. Humans have to transport the finished goods from the stores to their homes, and so the cycle continues.​
The major energy futures markets are the following:​
Energy:​
• Crude Oil    • Brent Crude    • Ethanol    • Natural Gas    • Heating Oil




What are Returns​
Overview
The reason we invest our money in shares is to increase our wealth. We increase our wealth by getting a good “return” on our investment. ​
​
In this module, we will investigate what we mean by the concept of return.

Defining Returns
The return on an investment consists of any dividend, interest, rent or other income added to the increase in the value of an asset over a set period, and is usually defined as a yearly percentage of the original investment. It is important to note that when investing in shares you can only get dividends and capital growth (increase in value of the share). ​
​
For example, you bought shares for R10.00 at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year the value of the shares increased to R11.75. During this period you received a dividends of 25c. This means that within the year your return consists of 25c dividend, plus R1.75 of capital growth, ie R2. This return is 20% (2/10) of your original investment of R10.00.​
​
When we make an investment in a share or any asset, we all want to get a good return on our investment. In simple language a return is the extra you get back over and above your initial investment and the higher that is the better.
 
1. Required Rate of Return
The required rate of return is the minimum rate of return you should accept from an investment, in order to reward you for not buying something today. ​
​
In other words, an investor invests in an investment today in order to enjoy the benefits and rewards at a later stage.​
​
The components of an investor’s required rate of return that will reward him/her for the risk taken are:​

The time value of money during the investment period,​
the expected rate of inflation during the investment period, and​
the risk involved.​

We will now discuss these individually.

1.Time Value of Money

The time value of money refers to how much a certain amount of money will be worth at a future date, when it has been invested at a certain rate of compound interest over a certain time frame.​
​
For example, say you invest R10,000 in a bank account that gives you 5% interest per year. After one year you will have R10,000 plus the 5% of R10,000 (which is R500). So in total you will have R10,500. ​
​
After two years you will have the R10,500 you had at the end of the first year plus 5% of the R10,500 (which is R525). So in total you will have R11,025 and so on.​
​
Investors generally prefer to receive their money back sooner rather than later so that they can grow it even more. Therefore, if they are willing to sacrifice the use of money for a definite time, some reward is required in return. What this means is that when you invest in a share, the share must do well enough in order to take the time value of money into account (i.e. it must do better for you than simply leaving the money in a bank account).

2. Inflation Adjusted Return

The increase (or decrease) in the general cost of goods and services in an economy is known as inflation. Inflation must be included in any calculation in order to properly reflect the value of the investment return now or at a later date. ​
In order to calculate the true value of your investment return adjusted to consider inflation rates, we first need to determine the value of the return.  This can be done by using the following formula:​
Return = (Final price - Starting price + Dividends) / (Starting price)​
We then need to determine the inflation rate over a period of time. This can be done using the following formula:​
Inflation = (Finishing CPI level - Starting CPI level) / Starting CPI level. It is also possible to look up the inflation rate for the year on the internet instead of using the above calculation.​
Lastly, we need to look at how the inflation effects the value of your retun. This can be done using the following formula:​
Inflation-adjusted return = (1 + Share Return) / (1 + Inflation) - 1​
 
2. Inflation Adjusted Return Example
Let's say for example you buy 1000 shares in Pharmaceutical company ABC at R100 per share at the beginning of the year. During that year the company paid out dividends of R10. At the end of the year, the share price came in at R120 per share. During this year, the national inflation rate was set at 0,06 or 6%.​
​Using the calculations we discussed previously, let's determine the inflation adjusted return of the investment in company ABC. ​
​We start off by calculating the return amount:​
(Ending price - Beginning price + Dividends) / (Beginning price) = Return​
(120 – 100 + 10) / (100) = 0,3 or 30% return*​
​
We then take the inflation rate of 0,06 or 6% and use it together with the 30% we just calculated into calculate the inflation adjusted return:​
(1 + Share Return) / (1 + Inflation) - 1 = Inflation-adjusted return​
(1 + 0,3) / (1 + 0,06) - 1 = Inflation-adjusted return 0,226 or 22,6% Inflation-adjusted return*​
​
​*Brokerage costs and taxes are not included in these examples
 
3. Risk Involved
Risk factors differ from one type of investment to another or from one type of environment to another. For example the risk of investing in small cap firms can be high, but the returns expected should pay off the risk taken.​
If there is some uncertainty that the capital amount will be repaid, a premium will be required by an investor. When there is a high degree of confidence about an investment’s return, for example, in the case of government bonds, the premium will be low. This is in line with one of the most important principles of financial management: that the return must be equal to the risk taken.​
The minimum rate of return required from any investment changes over time. This means that the rate of return does not remain constant but depends on expected changes in the three variables that we have talked about. It is important however, for you as an investor to achieve a return that rewards you for the amount invested, when there is any element of risk involved.




Currency Derivatives (Forex)
Overview
This module is an educational module on currency derivatives and will also give you an overview of the forex market.​
Forex trading is trading currencies, and there are two ways to do this:​

The first is trading via currency derivative​
The second is via the Foreign Exchange spot market ​

​
Please note that the JSE does not trade forex but rather currency derivatives. There are authorized dealers when it comes to trading forex and these are the institutions you would approach for this service.

Forex Overview
As a result of global trade and travel, it is common for the currency from one country to be exchanged for another country’s currency. This is done in order to facilitate cross border trade or investment.​
​
Foreign exchange is also commonly referred to as Forex or FX and is by far the largest financial market in the world. Although it is big, this market carries some real risks because of its high gearing/leverage. You can both make and lose a lot of money when investing in this market. ​
​
An interesting fact though is that the FX market is not physically housed in an actual central building of a country, but instead exists as a network of financial institutions connected to each other via various trading and communication platforms which allows for transacting with each other. In fact, in today’s connected world, anyone who has access to a computer and an online brokerage account can access this market with great ease.

Currency Derivatives Overview
The JSE’s Currency Derivatives Market trades in Currency Derivates which are regulated products that give you the chance to make  a profit by predicting on whether or not the rand will be strengthening or weakening against another currency, including: ​

United States dollar (USD - $)​
Euro (EUR - €)​
British pound (GBP - £)​
Australian dollar (AUD – $)​
Japanese yen (JPY - ¥)​
Chinese renminbi (CNY - ¥)​
Swiss franc (CHF – Fr)​
Botswana pula (BWP – P)​
New Zealand dollar (NZD - $​)
Canadian dollar (CAD - $)​

​
Trading on the Currency Derivatives market gives investors the opportunity to:​
Hedge against currency risk​
Diversify internationally ​
Take a view on the movement of underlying foreign exchange rates 

Currency Futures
A Currency Futures (CFs) Contract is an agreement between parties that gives the investor the right to buy or sell currency at a fixed exchange rate at a specific date in the future. In the contract, one party agrees to buy (longs) the Future at a specified exchange rate and the other party agrees to sell (shorts) it at the expiry date of the contract. When the contract expires, they are settled in cash and do not involve the physical delivery of foreign currency from one person to another. ​
​
The underlying tool used in a CF contract is the rate of exchange between one unit of the foreign currency and the South African Rand.

Currency Futures Example
For example, let's say that the Rand is sitting at R15 per US Dollar at the beginning of the year and you buy $1000. You predict that during the year, the Rand is going to strengthen in value against the Dollar to R10 per US Dollar. You enter into a CF Contract to sell your $1000 at the end of the year for R20,00 per Dollar.​
​
By the time the contract expired, the Rand had weakened to R17,50 per Dollar. Even through your prediction was wrong, you still set the selling price per Dollar at a higher amount than the market selling price and still manage to make some income from the contract.

Currency Options
A Currency Options (CO) Contract is an agreement that gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a Currency Futures Contract on a future date at a pre-set price. COs give investors the right to buy the underlying Currency Future whilst Put Options give them the right to sell it. ​
​
Investors are required to pay a premium for choice to exercise the Option or not. The premium is calculated based on the volatility of the underlying exchange rate defined in the CO. 




Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
Overview
We are going to discuss another avenue used for investing called Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).​
​
We will define ETFs, consider their features and understand who generally invests using these instruments.

Defining ETFs
Exchange Traded Funds or ETFs are listed investment products that track the performance of a group or "basket" of Shares, Bonds or single Commodities. These "baskets" are known as indices. An illustration of an index is the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index. ​
​
An ETF can be purchased or put up for sale in the same way as an Ordinary Share. Investors save time and money as ETFs enable an investor to invest in a variety of asset classes through a single listed investment product, at a fairly low cost.​
​
ETFs are essentially a hassle-free way to achieve entrance into the market and it is not necessary for extensive research into each and every underlying asset of the ETF. You can achieve a diversified portfolio without the administration hassle of a large portfolio and the cost associated with it.  ​
​
What’s more, if a share within the fund declares a dividend you will be entitled to it proportionally as a unit holder. Some ETFs do automatically re-invest these dividends back into the fund which means the effects of compounding are put to work in your favour too.

Who are ETFs For?
ETFs are used by both professional and private investors wishing to gain exposure to different sectors, asset classes – both locally and globally.​
They are the ideal investment vehicle for those who are new to the world of investing and are a great starting place for many individual investors who are looking to build a share portfolio. ​
There are many benefits to starting with these instruments in your portfolio until such time as you feel you have the necessary tools and skills to expand your investment journey.

Features of ETFs
ETFs have several features:​
​

Provides exposure to a variety of underlying instruments i.e. it offers diversification.​
Can be bought and sold quickly, at a low cost.​
Are hassle free; you gain exposure to a wide variety of securities or assets without having to do extensive research.​
Are well regulated by the JSE and the FSCA.​
May pay investors dividends when the underlying instruments held in the ETF pay dividends (not applicable to all ETFs).​
Are exempt from securities transfer tax (STT).​
Most JSE listed ETFs also Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) compliant​
ETF prices fluctuate, as do the prices of the ETFs’ underlying instruments. However, because of the advantage of diversification, the risk of losing money is spread out.

How to Get ETFs
There are several avenues that you can use to invest using ETFs:​
​

Open a brokerage account with an authorised JSE Equity member.​
Open an investment plan or use an online ETF platform, with an ETF provider or financial services provider (FSP). This way, you can easily buy ETFs with a monthly debit order or a single lump sum investment.





Warrants​
Overview
This module aims to offer insight into warrants – what they are and the two main categories of warrants.​
​
It will also explain who warrants are for and their main features.

Defining Warrants
Warrants are financial instruments that give investors the right, but not obligation, to buy (Call Warrants) or sell (Put Warrants) an underlying asset, at an agreed price (the strike price), on or before an agreed expiry date. ​
​The underlying assets can be Shares, Indices, Commodities or Currencies. Warrants are traded on the JSE’s Equity Market and issued by companies. Warrants differ from each other in terms of the type of their underlying asset or limits and the strike price at which the Warrant can be bought or sold.
Call Warrants
Warrants can be classified into 2 categories - Call Warrant and Put Warrant:​
​Call warrant gives the holder the option to purchase an underlying security at an agreed price. 
For example: If an investor believes that the price of Share A will increase they will buy a call warrant that allows them to purchase Share A at the strike price R100. If in future the price rises to R120 the warrants holder can exercise the right to purchase Share A at R100.
Put Warrants
Put warrant gives the holder the option to sell an underlying security at an agreed price. ​
For example: If an investor believes that the price of Share A will decrease they will buy a put warrant that allows them to sell Share B at the strike price R90. If in future the price drops to R80 the warrants holder can exercise the right to sell Share B at R90.
 
Types of Warrants
There are several types of warrants:​

Single Equity Warrants (Vanilla Warrants)​
They allow investors to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying share at a predetermined price on or before a specified date.​
Basket Warrants​
Basket Warrants are very similar to Vanilla Warrants except that the underlying asset consists of shares from a group of different companies. The companies concerned often carry out similar activities, for instance mining or transportation.​
Barrier Warrants​
Barrier Warrants are similar to Vanilla Warrants except that they have a barrier level. If the price of the underlying asset breaks this level, the warrant becomes worthless and holds no further rights to the holder of the warrant.​
Bond Warrants​
Bond Warrants are very similar to Vanilla Warrants except that the underlying asset is not a share, but a bond.​
Index Warrants​
Index Warrants are very similar to Vanilla Warrants except that the underlying asset is not a share but an Index. An Index Warrant is settled by cash payment, calculated using an index multiplier assigned by the issuer when the warrant is first issued.​
Discount Warrants​
Discount Warrants allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset at a lower cost than that of Vanilla Warrants. Investors are able to pay less for these warrants because, with Discount Warrants, the potential profit is limited compared with that of the more conventional Call and Put Warrants.
Capital Protection Warrants​
Capital Protection Warrants give the holder a guaranteed return. These warrants are in essence a combination of warrants (Single Equity warrants, Index Warrants and so on) and a risk-free investment.​
Currency Reference Warrants​
Currency Reference warrants give the holder exposure to the underlying exchange rate.​
Commodity Reference Warrants ​
Commodity Reference Warrants give the holder exposure to price movements in the underlying commodity.​
Reset Warrants​
Reset Warrants differ from Vanilla Warrants in that they have a pre-determined reset date on which the strike price of the warrant could be changed in the investor’s favour. This increases the probability of the warrant ending in the money and effectively gives the investor a second chance when an anticipated move in the underlying asset does not occur as initially expected. After the reset date, Reset Warrants behave like Vanilla Warrants.​

 
Who are Warrants For?
Investors wanting to gain geared exposure to the price movements of underlying assets invest using warrants.​
​Investors wanting to protect existing portfolios against adverse price movements can use Call Warrants when they believe the price of an underlying asset will increase, and Put Warrants when they believe it will decrease.
 
Features of Warrants
Warrants have the following features:​

Allow investors to benefit, whether asset prices are climbing or falling.​
The most an investor can lose from investing in a warrant is the initial price paid for the warrant.​
Warrants give investors exposure to a wide variety of asset classes.​
Warrants are highly liquid.​
Buying a warrant from a particular issuer implies that you are taking on the credit risk of that issuer.​
The prices of warrants move with those of the underlying assets and are subject to market risk because of social and economic unpredictability.​
The value of warrants can be more volatile than the value of the underlying share.​

To invest using warrants, you can open a brokerage account with a JSE Equity Market member.




Technical Analysis Fundamentals
Overview
In module 4 of the individual investor modules, there was an introduction to the two techniques that an investor can use when deciding on which shares to invest in - fundamental and technical analysis. That module gave deeper insights into fundamental analysis.​
​
This module will offer greater insight into the fundamentals of technical analysis including:​

defining technical analysis; ​
considering how it differs to fundamental analysis; ​
discussing the advantages of technical analysis as well as what to be cautious of when using this technique, and;​
looking at the tools of technical analysis.


Defining Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is the study of prices, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends. ​
Being a fundamental analyst interested in supply and demand poses several challenges: first getting timely, reliable information and, second, calculating the market impact of so many factors if you had the information. ​
Even if you were an insider and had perfect statistics for every supply and demand factor, a lot of other market participants don’t. Their perceptions and opinions might be far different from yours and their deduction of value might be well off the mark of what the current supply-demand figures suggest. ​
However, in a free-market setting, there is one element that incorporates changes in  fundamental factors, big or small, and the interpretation of those factors. What’s more, this element is not a secret limited to insiders but is readily available to all, without regard to their knowledge of the fundamentals. ​
This element is price. The statistics that the fundamentalists study are past history, usually already out-of-date and sterile, because the market is not interested in the past or even in the present. It is continuously looking forward; trying to discount future developments, weighing and comparing all the estimations and guesses of hundreds of thousands of investors who look into the future from various points of view. In short, the going price, as determined by the market itself, understands all fundamental information which the statistical fundamental analyst can desire to learn (as well as some which is possibly secret to him, known only to a few insiders) and much else besides of equal or even greater importance. 
 
Fundamental vs Technical Analysis
Whereas technical analysis is focused on the study of prices, fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and demand that affect price movements. The fundamentalist examines all the relevant and available information affecting the price of a share in order to determine the intrinsic value of that share. ​
​The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals indicate a share is worth based on the laws of supply and demand. If this intrinsic value is under the market price, then the share is overpriced and should be sold and vice versa. Fundamental analysis is when you look at the company's cashflow statement, balance sheet, and the value of the shares amongst other ratios. You can also engage the management of the company as well as company news to gain a clearer picture of its performance.​​
​No matter where you perch in the marketplace you can’t know all the motivations that prompt buy and sell decisions. But these hundreds and thousands of decisions do leave tracks – prices and patterns. Studying these tracks is the art or science known as technical analysis. The function of price is to integrate supply-demand relationships. 
 
How Technical Analysis Works
When a student of price allows fear and greed to influence his market response, he loses many opportunities in the market whether he is buying or selling or doing nothing. The student must at all times resist these two emotions. In order to conquer fear and greed, confidence and courage are needed. Courage is inborn. Confidence is gained by study, study and more study. ​
Technical analysts are of the thinking that it is futile to study company financial statements, earnings and dividend reports, industry developments and other data in an attempt to determine the “underlying value” of market devices including shares. ​
They believe that a share can vary in price from well below the book value to well above the book value and this wide divergence between the intrinsic value and actual market price is commonplace. ​
The technical analyst does not care what the underlying forces of a shift in the supply – demand are, rather in what occurs, as all the information known is all included and distilled into just one item, price. Instead of trying to assess supply and demand and all the other factors that make up a market, technical analysis studies the action of prices and the market itself. Should demand outweigh supply, prices will increase. On the other hand, if supply is greater than demand, price will fall. The real value of a share at any point in time is determined solely by supply and demand - which is reflected in the price.​
The thing that makes technical analysis attractive is that it can be applied successfully to practically any trading medium and investment time horizon. A technician can analyse shares, options, commodities, bonds, and numerous other forms of investments for buy and sell opportunities, and can do so by studying moment-by-moment, intraday, day-to-day, weekly, or monthly data – from extremely short-term to extremely long-term viewpoints. The technician can easily follow as many markets as desired, which is generally not true for his or her fundamental counterpart. Because of the tremendous amount of data the fundamental analysts must deal with, most of them tend to specialize in one market.  
 
Advantages of Technical Analysis
The fundamentalist analyzes the cause of movement in the market, while the technician considers the effect. The technician believes that the effect is all that he or she needs to know and that the reasons are not necessary, while on the other hand the fundamentalist always has to know why. ​
​Typically at the start of crucial market moves, the fundamentals do not clarify or back up what the market seems to be doing. It is at these critical stages in the trend that the two approaches seem to differ the most. ​
​One reason for these differences is that the market price has a tendency of leading the known fundamentals and prices are now responding to the unknown fundamentals. ​
​Technical analysis attempts to bypass some of the uncertainty of fundamental factors, which are often contradictory and difficult to “weigh” by concentrating on how the market is actually reacting. ​
​One cannot know all the motivations that prompt buy and sell decisions but all these decisions do leave tracks by its price action. A trend indicates that there exists an inequality between the forces of supply and demand. Such action in the forces of supply and demand is usually readily identifiable by the action of the market itself as displayed in the prices. Often it is not just the price itself that is important but how fast or how slow or how far from the “normal” is the price movement. 
1. Adaptability​
One of the greatest strengths of technical analysis is its adaptability to virtually any trading medium and time dimension. The chartist can easily follow as many markets as desired which is generally not true for his or her fundamental counterpart. Because of the tremendous amount of data the latter must deal with, most fundamentalists tend to specialize in one market. The advantages here should not be overlooked.​
​2. Big Picture​
Another advantage the technician has is the “big picture.” By following all of the markets, he or she gets an excellent feel for what markets are doing in general, and avoids the “tunnel vision” that can result from following only one market. ​
​3. Handles Different Time Dimensions​
A further strength of technical analysis is its ability to handle different time dimensions. Whether the user is trading the intra-day tic-by-tic changes for day trading purposes or trend trading the intermediate trend, the same principles apply. 
 
Caution Around Technical Analysis
Critics of the technical approach tend to have two main arguments. The first argument is that chart patterns have been so broadly published in the last numerous years which has resulted in many traders being very familiar with these patterns, and regularly acting on them in concert. This produces a “self-fulfilling prophecy,” as surges of buying or selling are formed in reaction to bullish or bearish patterns. ​
​The second argument is that chart patterns are almost fully biased. There has been no successful study in terms of mathematically quantifying any of these patterns. They are in the mind of the beholder.
​The truth of the matter is that charting is very subjective. Chart reading is an art and the patterns are seldom so clear that even experienced technicians always agree on their interpretation. There is always an element of doubt and disagreement. Let’s say most technicians did approve a market forecast, it still would not necessarily result in them entering the market at the same time and in the same way. 
There is a saying in Wall Street to the effect that “there is nothing wrong with charts – the trouble is with the chartists.” Which is simply another way of communicating the truth that what is important is the interpretation of the chart and not the chart itself. ​
Traders are inclined to lose impartiality when they make use of technical analysis indicators. The trader cannot stay objective and the bias of using the indicator overpowers him. It probably has to do with the compulsion many traders feel to have to trade. They are then inclined to undermine their indicators by trading when the signal is not completely clear. ​
Traders have the tendency to test their systems and indicators on an insufficient amount of data. Analysts need to test trading systems and technical indicators on a wide array of data in different types of trading markets. Additionally, many traders and analysts don’t forward test their trading systems and technical indicators in real time. There is a rush to trade based on insufficient back testing and forward testing. Thus it is really hope they are trading on and not a sound, valid basis. ​
Numerous traders neglect to include sound risk management practices in their trading systems. Furthermore, a lot of traders fail to include stop loss orders with their original orders when they use technical indicators only. ​
So what makes a good technical trader? The best technical traders use technical indicators and intuition, and the one thing they all have in common whether they can articulate them or not, they all have a set of well-defined rules they trade by.
 
The Technician’s Tools
Charts are the technical analyst’s operating tools. They are like a map showing you where a share has been and where it “might” be going. ​
There are a number of different charts that can be used for technical analysis including but not limited to:​
​

Line charts​
Bar charts​
Candlestick charts​
Point and figure charts​

​Many technical indicators can be used on these charts such as moving averages, moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) or relative strength index (RSI) to name a few.​
​The type of chart and the time period that is used by a technical analyst is dependent upon what information they consider to be most important, and which charts and time period ideally suits them. These charts can range from time periods of one minute to yearly charts. Probably the most used chart is a daily chart plotting the closing price of the day.




Technical Analysis: Trendlines​
Overview
This module delves deeper into technical analysis and focuses specifically on trendlines, and how they prove useful to the trader.​
​
There are many topics in technical analysis that you can study and this module is one of many examples that you can look into.

Defining Trendlines
Trend lines are lines that are drawn at an angle above or below the price. They provide indications about the immediate trend and show when a trend has changed. They can also function as support and resistance and offer opportunities to open and close positions.

The Trend is Your Friend
The supply and demand balance establishes a trend. A trend indicates that there exists an inequality between the forces of supply and demand. The notion of trend is extremely critical to the technical approach. The intention behind charting the price action is to pinpoint trends in the initial stages of their development for the objective of trading in the direction of those trends. There is an effect to the premise that prices move in trends – a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse. This effect is, of course, an adaptation of Newton’s first law of motion. Another way to state this effect is that a trend in motion will continue until it reverses. ​
​Long-term trends can be interrupted by corrective short-term trends before continuing within the long-term channel, or market action can move sideways and create patterns or congestion areas between levels of resistance and levels of support as a process of distribution (supply) and accumulation (demand) takes place at these levels respectively. ​
​
​These patterns can be continuation patterns as prices move from one box (or pattern) to a higher box, more frequently found in bull markets, or to a lower box, more frequently found in bear markets. ​
​The patterns can be reversal patterns, as supply overcomes demand and finally breaks a long-term trend. 
It is important to understand that trends and patterns are people trends and patterns based on crowd psychology. In other words, it is very important to understand that technical analysis is a behavioural science and a good psychologist would probably be more successful as a technical analyst, as an expert on personal behaviour and emotions, and on crowd behaviour and the herd instinct. ​
​In human nature it is a known and documented fact that people in a crowd soon lose their individuality creating a herd instinct, and conforms to their environment, which causes them to move in a more predictable manner. ​
​Human nature is such that it tends to react to similar situations in consistent ways. As a rule, people will act in the same way as they have in the past. ​
​The idea of trend is very important to the technical approach to market analysis. All the tools used by the chartist – support and resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines etc. – have the single goal of assisting with measuring the trend of the market for the aim of participating in that trend. We often hear expressions such as “the trend is your friend,” “never buck the trend.” This ability of price to cling extremely close to a straight line is one of the most extraordinary characteristics of chart movements. Another important characteristic is that when a share is found to be following a given trend line, it is more likely to continue moving along that line, than not to. 
 
Drawing Trendlines
It is perhaps obvious that the longer a share has been moving along a given trend or within a given channel, the stronger that trend is likely to be. For this reason, trendlines on longer-range charts such as weekly or monthly bar charts are usually more reliable than trendlines that form on intraday or daily bar charts. ​
Even when shares break away from an established trendline and signal a true shift in direction, they have a tendency to return to it. This magnetic attraction of the old trend is called a “pull-back” effect and is common to trendlines. Prices move in a series of peaks and troughs and the direction of these peaks and troughs determine the trend. ​
An uptrend is a continuous series of higher “highs” and higher “lows” and is drawn by connecting the lower points of a share movement line (A-G). Another feature of trendlines on bar charts is that a parallel line (B-H) often develops and produces a well-defined “channel”. ​
When a sideways trend forms, both upper and lower points often conform to parallel, straight horizontal lines. This type of sideways action reflects a period of equilibrium in the price level where the forces of supply (B & D) and demand (A & C) are in a state of relative balance. ​
​ It is essential to have a solid grasp of the concepts of support and resistance in order to fully understand the concept of trend. For an uptrend to continue, each successive low (support level) must be higher than the one preceding it. Every single rally high (resistance level) needs to be greater than the one prior to it. ​
​If the corrective drop in an uptrend falls all the way down to the preceding low, it could be an early indication that the uptrend is halting or at least moving from an uptrend to a sideways trend. If the support level is violated, then a trend reversal from up to down is likely. ​
​On every occasion that a former resistance peak is being tested, the uptrend is in a particularly critical phase. Failure to exceed a previous peak in an uptrend or the inability of prices to violate the previous support low in a downtrend is usually the first warning that the existing trend is changing. ​
 
Psychology of Support & Resistance Levels
At any one time in the market place there are three categories of participants – the longs, the shorts, and the uncommitted. The longs have already purchased shares, the shorts have already committed themselves to the sell side and the uncommitted are those who have sold previously and are waiting to re-enter, or who have remained undecided. ​
​Assuming the market moves higher from a support area, where prices have been fluctuating for some time. ​
The longs that bought near the support area (A) will obviously be delighted, but regret not having bought more. If only the market would dip back near that support area again they would add to their long positions. The shorts now begin to realize that they are on the wrong side of the market and are hoping that the market dips back where they went short so that they can get out of the market where they got in and allow them to break even. ​
​Those sitting on the side-lines that previously liquidated their positions too early are of course regretting their decision to sell prematurely and are hoping for another chance to reinstate their previous long positions. The undecided that had remained uncommitted, now finally realize that prices are going higher and resolve to enter the market on the long side on the next buying opportunity, which would obviously be at the support level.
All these groups are resolved to buy the next dip. They all have a “vested interest” in that support level under the market. Naturally if prices do fall near to that support, renewed buying by all these groups will result in pushing prices up. The more trading that takes place in that support area and the longer it takes the more significant and potent that support level becomes. The additional buying will create new levels of support with each downside reaction after the market advances as new buying takes place at these levels. Now let’s turn the tables and instead of prices moving higher, prices in fact move lower. ​
If prices start to drop below the previous support area, the reaction becomes just the opposite. All those who bought in that support area now realize that they made a mistake, and become sellers. This guides us into one of the more remarkable and lesser-recognized qualities of support and resistance – their role reversal. Each Time a support or resistance level is permeated by a significant amount, they switch roles. A resistance level converts to a support level and a support level switches into a resistance level. 
The thing that produced the previous support to begin with was the high proportion of buy orders under the market. Now, however, all the previous buy orders under the market have become sell orders over the market. Support has become resistance. The more significant that previous support area was – the more potent it now becomes as a resistance area. All of the factors that created support by all three categories of participants – the longs, the shorts and the uncommitted – will now function to put a ceiling over prices on subsequent rallies to these levels. ​
​Technical analysis is actually a study of human psychology and the reaction of traders to changing market conditions.
The study of support and resistance can tell an investor whether his ship is on course. As long as support levels hold firm, he can feel that his shares are doing well and he may buy more. If his shares breaks through a support level he has cause for concern, and may consider selling out. ​
Some traders use their studies of support and resistance to set up practical trading systems. They buy when shares have fallen to support levels, or when shares have risen and broken through resistance levels. They sell when shares hit resistance levels or fall through support levels. ​
If a share breaks out of a trading range of 50 – 55 and climbs, say, to 58, the previous resistance point of 55 becomes a support level. The short-term trader may not wish to hold on to the share if, on a downswing, it penetrates the 55 level. Longer-term traders may be content to hold the share as long as the lower level of the support zone (50) is not broken. ​
​On daily charts the bottom of a support zone is considered more valid than the top. Very frequently a rising share will react back into a support zone and then resume its advance. A new support level may then form within the previous support zone and become the next valid support. ​
​Weekly and monthly charts also reveal support and resistance levels, and are convenient for spotting long-established or “historic” levels for support and resistance. The potency of support and resistance has a tendency to fade with time, but many surprising examples exist which have proved to be significant. ​
​As noted previously, an object in motion (a trend) will continue in motion until it meets an opposing force (support or resistance). The technical analyst continually works with both these tools, and he finds that they help each other. Trendlines help confirm support and resistance levels, while support and resistance levels help confirm and anticipate new trendlines.
 
Creating a Trading Strategy Using Trendlines
STEP ONE: Define the medium to longer-term trend ​
​To define the medium term channel (i.e. the medium term support and resistance levels) select a medium to longer-term time scale (either select the daily (compressed like the previous chart of the Rand) or the weekly chart to the left). ​
​I can now identify what my next move is, either buying or selling the Euro. Remembering that the medium term channel dominates this decision. In other words over the medium term, the probabilities of the Euro continuing to weaken against the US Dollar is higher than the probabilities of the Euro strengthening against the US Dollar. 
STEP TWO: Define the short-term trend and stop placement ​​
There are many different strategies one can come with by looking at the chart in the previous slide; the important thing is that you choose a strategy that best suits you the individual that is putting the money in. In other words assess your risk before entry, determine your exit strategy first and foremost and always make sure that for what you are risking your potential profit is at least three times bigger. ​
​Too many people think about what could go right in the markets (how much money they could make) and ignore their stop losses or worse do not place any stops in the market. The first thought before entering the market should be about what could go wrong and how long am I going to stay wrong for.​
Stop placement is essential for successful trading, placing your stops incorrectly could cause you to be whipsawed in and out of the market like a yoyo leaving you to desert your stop losses and taking much bigger losses than you wanted to. ​




ITaC
Overview
The ITaC project was successfully implemented into production on Monday, 29 April 2019.
“ITaC” is the abbreviation used for the JSE’s Integrated Trading and Clearing initiative. The ITaC project is a multi‐year programme of work focused on the introduction of an integrated solution for the JSE’s trading and clearing services. 
The objective of the project is to implement world‐class, multi‐product solutions to enhance the JSE’s current trading and clearing functions: on the trading ​side, that means migrating all Derivatives and Cash Bond markets to the MillenniumIT trading platform, while for clearing, it involves the migration of all markets onto the new Cinnober Real‐Time Clearing (RTC) solution.
The implementation of ITaC will bring a host of changes to JSE’s Trading, Clearing and Market Data services, in an effort to align the JSE with international best practice and to ensure that they leverage the benefits of their new technology platforms.

Trade Reporting
 

Branches 


If your counterparty is trading within a Branch, please ensure you capture the following information on the trade report: 

Secondary Trade Report ID (Branch code) 
Your account/client code, e.g. ABC123 




Selection of Trade Type, e.g. Negotiated Trade, Roll Trade, etc. 
Cannot amend details of any trade report details, instead the member capturing the trade report would need to withdraw the trade before it is accepted or the receiving member will need to reject the trade should it contain incorrect information. 

Please liaise with your Software Provider on how you are setup to trade with a branch 
Trade Cancellation
On Book Trades 

JSE Surveillance may instruct a member(s) to cancel a matched trade should the criteria be met to effect such 

Parameters

Request for cancellation must be submitted to Market regulation within 20 minutes of erroneous trade execution 
Minimum loss potential R50 000 

Off Book Trades 

Off Book trades can be cancelled at the mutual agreement of members 
Only Same Day cancellations are permitted 
Next Day cancellations are done through an Equal Opposite reported trade 

Deal management and cancelled trades 

If a trade was deal managed before it was cancelled, the equal and opposite trade created by the cancellation can be deal managed to ‘undo’ the effects of the original trade 
A same day trade cancellation performed on the Trading System will result in a system generated equal and opposite trade in the Clearing System - It is this equal and opposite trade that can be deal managed to reverse the effects of the original trade 
For example if the initial trade was allocated to a client account, the equal and opposite trade resulting from the trade cancellation should be allocated to the same client account to ensure a net zero effect on the client’s position

Changes to Dividend Neutral Futures 

Current system (Nutron) 

Dividend Neutral is a virtual contract. 
Dividend Neutral (N contract) = SSF(Q) and Dividend Future (F). 
At Ex Div, the JSE process a Journal transaction on the Dividend Future. 


New system (ITaC) 

Dividend Future will no longer exist. 
Dividend Neutral contract will now be “single” contract. 
No Journal transaction will be processed on this contract. 



Reason for removing the virtual Dividend Future: when Members roll over their SSF contracts to the next expiry, they do not always roll the Dividend Future.

Commodities: Influencers & Forwards​
Overview
This is a brief module that will look at:​​

What influences the price of a commodity​
Global markets, local impact on commodities​
Forward markets


What Influences the Price of a Commodity
When it comes to commodities the first key take away is that the standard influencers of price action are a bit different. The general market forces of “supply and demand” that are commonly at work in a typical financial contract take on an entirely different role when it comes to commodities. When calculating the price of an FX forward the implied cost of interest rate differentials are taken into account (in other words the carry cost). Similarly when we evaluate the price action of bonds we conclude that the price of the bond is the present value of all its future cash flows, discounted at some desired rate of return.​
​
With commodities though, this calculation gets a bit more complex. The price of a commodity is primarily driven by supply and demand.​
​
You will recall that commodities are different to other financial securities in that it represents something that Mother Nature creates and influences. In other words the actual physical availability of the underlying commodity is not guaranteed.​
​
Let’s take grain for example, if there is no rain then the crop yields will be very low resulting in supply to be less than usual. On the contrary a flood could do equal amounts of damage, so conditions need to be “just right” to experience the optimum level of production.​
​
So with this as backdrop it is clear that although there is some sort of baseline price for each commodity driven by the traditional supply and demand forces at work in any market, the momentary variances in price could be quite extreme when some of these unpredictable events occur, influencing the physical supply or reserves available for any particular commodity.​
It's important to note that  each year holds its own opportunities and challenges with commodities especially agricultural markets. There are so many factors influencing grain prices such as weather, which plays a critical role in estimates for supply and demand, and politics, export/import restrictions/bans, macroeconomics (oil price & exchange fluctuations), and logistics (inland or ocean/choke points/strikes etc.). Each commodity has its own price drivers since they differ, however, the aforementioned are the most prevalent across all commodities. 

Global Markets, Local Impact
Another interesting concept which is particularly prevalent with commodities is the fact that although prices trade on a global platform, access to this market is not as easy. When one trades bonds or shares, or any financial asset or security for that matter, there truly is no real global constraints holding one back from accessing different markets.​
​
As an example, to transact in AB InBev shares is equally easy when done on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange. This ensures that global prices remain somewhat in line.​
​
The concept behind it is called arbitrage. Arbitrate refers to the ability to make “practically risk free” profits. Using our example of AB InBev, the implied price of AB InBev shares traded in Pounds, at any given level of exchange rate is fairly close to the Rand equivalent price of AB InBev shares on the JSE.​
​
If there was a big discrepancy arbitrageurs will buy shares in the UK and sell the shares in South Africa or vice versa to capitalise on any momentary mismatch in pricing. After all, it all refers to shares of the very same company, so the two markets should be in check.​
​
In the commodity markets this is not always the case though, and for good reason.
Consider a South African farmer of maize sitting with the following dilemma. Due to a bumper harvest this year, there is more maize than needed in South Africa. As such, the price of the maize has fallen. All the silos are filled up with maize and nowhere to go.​
Offshore though is a different story all together. Due to a severe drought in the heartland of America, the crop sizes for maize under produced to a large extent. So much so that there is a huge shortage of maize in the States.​
As a result of this the offshore USD denominated maize prices are far higher than the maize prices currently observed in South Africa. When considering that South Africa already sits on surplus stock, it is quite obvious that our farmer will jump at the opportunity to sell maize offshore, and as an added bonus be able to obtain far better prices.​
This also plays into the example given of AB InBev, by our farmer selling stock offshore, it should have the following beneficial outcomes:​
1. Reduce the supply in South Africa, which should cause prices to drift higher.​
2. Increase the supply in the States, which should be able to now service the demand and lead to lower prices.​
3. The net result should be a global balancing of relative price levels, correct?​
Quite often this is not the case. In reality, our local farmer cannot get enough maize out of the country fast enough to service this demand and will have to sit on the side-lines while his profits disappear. This could be due to a combination of the following:​
• Not enough railway infrastructure to cart all the maize from the silos to the ports.​
• Not enough port capacity to clear and load dry bulk ships at the speed required to service the demand before prices stabilise as a result of other countries supplying the US with their own excess.​
Just another example of how interesting the commodity market can be, trying to bridge the gap between the capacity of real world bricks and mortar vs. the demand of the financial markets.​

Forward Markets
The forward market for all financial contracts are based upon the “cost of carry” to take the position from the current value to the future spot value date. For the most part, this is no different for commodity contracts.​
Forward - Traditional Financial Security​
• Spot rate + Cost of Interest​
​
Commodity Forward​
• Spot rate + Cost of Interest   • Storage • Insurance • Transport • Inspection​
​
In other words, one would derive any particular forward dates price, by working out the cost of acquiring the commodity today at spot, and then adding on top of this, the funding cost of money. For commodities though the cost of moving the position into the forward also includes something not present with financial contracts, and that’s the costs incurred when handling physical goods.​
In this instance one would have to account for:​
• Storage Costs       • Lease rates       • Insurance rates       • Inspection rates​
​
However, once all the costs have been taken into account one would be able to calculate and agree on the cost of a forward based off current prevailing spot levels. For the party who enters into the future transaction, the future contract represents an obligation to transact at the agreed price, and at the pre-agreed future date.




​Bonds: Determining Interest & Yields​
Overview
This module delves a little deeper into bonds and specifically outlines how to calculate interest – simple and compounded – as well as yields – basic and implied – on your investment.​

It also briefly discusses present and future value calculations.

It is beneficial to understand the process of earning interest as “putting resources” to work for us. It is also important to understand that if earning interest on interest is a good thing, then the following two scenarios will be even better:​
• Earning a higher rate of interest​
• The more frequently our interest gets allocated to us, the better​
​
In essence, we need to emphasise the importance of having your “resources” work as hard as possible (higher interest rate) and for as long as possible (interest capitalisation frequency).​
​
The table on the left shows just how the actual amount of interest earned changes over a 12 month investment made with R1,000 at 10%. In each case, the actual interest earned on the deposit is capitalised at different intervals.​

Investment 1 000.00​
Rate 10%​
Days per month 30

The table above clearly highlights the importance of the interest frequency. Even when starting out with the same amount and the same interest rate, the compounding frequency makes a significant difference. The more frequent the capitalisation, the more beneficial.​
​
A sharp eye would have picked up the fact that one cannot just refer to an interest rate as being 10%, without also stating the compounding frequency. A deposit yielding 10% with interest capitalised monthly is in fact equivalent to a higher effective interest rate should we wish to compare it to an investment that only capitalises interest once a year.​
​
Recall from the table above, that the rate of 10%, when capitalised annually only yielded anamount of R98.63 in interest. However when interest is capitalised monthly it made R103.21 so to compare these two investments, the equivalent annual rate on our monthly capitalisation will be higher when shown as an effective rate for interest earned over the entire year.​
​
In order to clarify this issue, when interest rates are quoted, it is customary to include the compounding frequency as one of the following:​
• Nominal Annual Compounded Monthly (NACM)​
• Nominal Annual Compounded Quarterly (NACQ)​
• Nominal Annual Compounded Semi Annually (NACS)​
• Nominal Annual Compounded Annually (NACA)​

Simple Interest Rate Calculations
There is a standard procedure to follow when we work out interest rates. The formula to calculate interest due = Investment Amount x Interest Rate**​
​
To adjust the interest to accurately reflect the interest due for a specific period, one would have to divide the interest rate by the Day Base, and then multiply it by the amount of days you would wish to hold the investment for.​
​
The Day Base refers to how many days there are in a year. For the Rand market we use 365 days, but for some instruments and in some international markets the day base of 360 is used.​
​
It makes life easier when the following pertinent steps are kept in mind when dealing in interest rate calculations:​

When you apply the interest rate to an amount, the first answer you will get is an amount of interest which will be paid on the investment if held for a FULL YEAR.​
Once you have this amount, we can work out how much interest is earned per day​
Once we have the daily interest earned, we can now accurately calculate the interest due for any period you wish to calculate for.​

​
** The interest percentage needs to be adjusted for the specific period/length of the investment​
​
Let’s look at an example.​
Example 1: DEPOSIT​
Investment amount of R1, 000​
Simple Interest Rate = 10%​
Investment Period = 30 Days​
How much interest will this deposit earn?​
​
Interest due = Investment Amount x Interest Rate**​
** The interest percentage needs to be adjusted for the specific period/length of the investment​
​
Interest due = 1,000 x 10% ÷ 365 x 30​
Following our steps highlighted above:​
Step 1: Interest Per Year Step 2: Interest Per Day​
= 1000 x 10% = 100 ÷ 365​
= 1000 x 0.1 = 0.27397 per day​
= 100​
​
Step 3: How many days?​
= 0.27397 x 30 days​
= 8.22​
​
By following the three steps it becomes very easy to calculate the interest that is earned over a period of 30 days. It would have been equally easy to work out if the amount of days were to change to 48 or 67 days as all we would do is multiply the interest per day (0.27397) with the correct amount of days in our deposit.

Compounding Interest Rate Calculations
As indicated, calculating simple interest is in fact very easy. So why is it so tricky to consider compounding interest? What has changed? In essence the answer lies in the following statement.​
​
The calculation of the actual amount of interest due does not change at all, and is in fact exactly the same as what we did when calculating simple interest. The ONLY difference is that the amount on which we calculate the interest changes with every compounding.​
​
In other words, nothing changes other than having to adjust for a changing initial investment value as the interest gets added:​
​
Interest Earned on Investment 1 = Investment Amount x Interest Rate**​
Interest Earned on Investment 2 = [Investment 1 plus interest earned] x Interest Rate**​
Interest Earned on Investment 3 = [Investment 2 plus interest earned] x Interest Rate**​
​
** In all cases the interest percentage needs to be adjusted for the specific period/length of that particular investment in the exact same way we have done before
We once again will follow the 3 steps shown earlier, with step 4 added with every compounding date:​
​
1. When you apply the interest rate to an amount, the first answer you will get is an amount of interest which will be paid on the investment if held for a FULL YEAR.​
2. Once you have this amount, we can work out how much interest is earned per day​
3. Once we have the daily interest earned, we can now accurately calculate the interest due for any period you wish to calculate for.​
4. Add the interest earned for that period to the amount invested, this new amount now will become the amount earning interest​
​
It should now be very easy to note that compounding can be compared to rolling over of an investment when it matures. Shown in our example below will be an investment for 2 months (60 days) where interest compounds monthly (after 30 days). This is in fact exactly the same as saying, make an investment for 30 days, and at maturity roll it over by a month. In other words, place the full maturing principal plus interest on deposit again for another month.
Let’s look at this compounding example.​
Example 2: DEPOSIT FOR 2 MONTHS WHERE INTEREST CAPITALISES MONTHLY​
Investment amount of R1, 000​
Simple Interest Rate = 10% NACM​
Investment Period = 60 Days​
​
How much interest will this deposit earn?​
Interest Earned Month 1 = Investment Amount x Interest Rate**​
Interest Earned Month 2 = [Investment 1 plus interest earned] x Interest Rate**​
​
Following our steps highlighted above:​
Month 1: Interest Per Year Month 2: Interest Per Year​
= 1000 x 10% = 1008.22 x 10%​
= 1000 x 0.1 = 1008.22 x 0.1​
= 100 = 100.822​
Step 2: Interest Per Year Step 2: Interest Per Year​
= 100 ÷ 365 = 100.822 ÷ 365​
= 0.27397 per day = 0.27622 per day​
​
Step 3: How many days? Step 3: How many days?​
= 0.27397 x 30 days = 0.27622 x 30 days​
= 8.22 = 8.29​
So after month two the maturing deposit will be worth R1, 008.22 + 8.29​
​
At this point, note that even though month 2 also had thirty days, and our deposit was still also earning 10%, it earned more interest than in month 1. This due to the fact that by us capitalizing the interest from month 1, or new deposit amount on which we are earning interest at 10% has increased to 1,008.22 which results in more interest. This is the power of compounding interest.​
It now becomes evident that when evaluating future values one need to be 100% clear about the compounding frequency. As seen above, by using the incorrect frequency our future value will indeed be incorrect.​
This is also true when trying to figure out the present value of a strip of future cash flows.​
​
Future Value Calculations
Future value is when you would have a known value of funds today already, and you wish to know by how much this value will grow, given the interest rate and period involved.​
Working out the future value of an investment is surprisingly easy. ​
Examples would be:​
• Making an investment of R1000 into a 6 month fixed deposit and figuring out how much it will be worth when it matures.​
• Borrowing R1000 for a year, and working out how much you need to save up to repay this loan.​
The simplest way to calculate the future value of an instrument is by using the following formula.​
Future value = Present Value + Interest​
​
Remember that interest rate can be expressed in a number of ways such as simple or compounded. ​
​
For the purposes of this module we will only consider SIMPLE INTEREST, in other words, we will not be looking at any compounding interest calculations for now.​
In the below example we will look at how much an investment will be worth in two months from now. We can work out the future amount using the following formula.​
Example 1:​
When Interest is added at the end of the period only:​
Future Value = present Value + (Present Value x Interest x Day / Day Base)​
FV = PV + (PV x i x Day / Day Base)​
​
Example:​
Investment today (PV) = R1 000​
Interest rate (i) = 10%​
Day = 60​
Day Base = 365​
​
FV = 1,000 + (1,000 x 0.10 x 60÷365)​
FV = 1,016.44​
We can summarise the answer by stating, R1, 000 invested today at an interest rate of 10% effective annual interest, equates to an amount of R1, 016.44 maturing in two months from now.​

Present Value Calculations
The Present Value of a string of cash flows is the current value as if you were to receive all the cash flows today. In order to obtain this value, one would have to discount all the future values by a desired rate of return.​
Having worked out the future value in the example above, we can just as easily start at the other end and work our way backwards. We can easily rephrase the question as follows: What is the current value of a deposit maturing in two months from now at a maturing amount of R1, 016.44 when effective annual interest rates are set at 10%?​
​
Example 2:​
Present Value using Simple Interest:​
Present Value = [Future Value] ÷ [1 + (Interest x Day / Day Base)]​
Example:​
Investment Future Maturing Value (FV) = R1, 016.44​
Interest rate (i) = 10%​
Day = 60​
Day Base = 365​
Present Value = [1 016.44] ÷ [1 + (0.1 x 60 / 365)]​
Present Value = 1,000​
When looking at these calculations it becomes easy to see the link between future and present values. In our example above we proved that given an interest rate of 10%, you will be completely indifferent to having R1, 000 in your bank account today, or for you to receive an amount of R1,016.44 in two months from now.​
​
It once again needs to be highlighted that these examples do not take into effect the fact that for some instruments we would need to account for the compounding effect of interest rates. In which case, the formulas would look a little different. The overarching concept however remains the same. As long as we compare apples to apples, we will be able to draw a conclusion of how much any amount is worth today vs its implied future value.​

Basic Yield Calculations
A yield can be defined as the income (return) one would make on an investment. In other words, the yield will express the return as a percentage of the amount invested. This is important to understand, any investment return received needs to be compared to how much was needed in order to generate the return.​
In other words, assuming we have two completely different investment products to choose from. Comparing a return of R100 earned on each of the two separate investments is of little use, without knowing how much we have to invest in each.
​
Comparing R500 invested in investment 1 to R1, 000 invested in the other, quickly indicates to us that investment number 1 yielded the highest return.​
How did we arrive to this conclusion?​
Simple, by taking our amount of income generated (our return) and dividing it by the amount we invested will show the percentage return made by each investment.​
Investment 1                          Investment 2​
Amount Invested: R500          Amount Invested: R1, 000​
Interest Earned: R100            Interest Earned: R100​
Yield = 100 ÷ 500                   Yield = 100 ÷ 1,000​
YIELD = 20%                         YIELD = 10%​
We therefore can compare one investment to the next by comparing its yield, this way we know immediately how much we can expect to return on our own individual amount we choose to invest.​
​
As with most interest-bearing instruments calculating the future return when the yield is known is as simple as stating the following:​
Maturing Value = Amount Invested x Yield x [Day Count]**​
**The [Day Count] is typically reflected as the amount of days invested (d) ÷ the amount of days per year (DB)​
​
Example: 1 (Calculating the future value using Yield Rates)​
An investment of R1000​
At a yield of 5%​
For 45 Days​
​
Interest = 1000 x 0.05 x (45 ÷ 365)​
Interest = 6.16​
​
Future Value = Present Value + Interest​
= 1,000 + 6.16​
= 1,006.16​

Implied Yield Calculations
Understanding how yields work, we will also now be able to calculate the yield which is implied by two cash flows.​
Keeping with our previous example, we could have also rephrased the question as follows:​
If I have an investment of R1000 matures to the value of R1, 006.16 after a period of 45 days, what is the implied yield of this investment?​
How would we calculate the yield now? Do you recall our steps to follow which were highlighted at the start of this module? Let’s recap those again:​
When dealing in interest rate calculations:​
1. When you apply the interest rate to an amount, the first answer you will get is an amount of interest which will be paid on the investment if held for a FULL YEAR.​
2. Once you have this amount, we can work out how much interest is earned per day​
3. Once we have the daily interest earned, we can now accurately calculate the interest due for any period you wish to calculate for.​
So knowing how the process works in general, when working out implied yields all that is required from us is to start at point 3 and work our way back. In other words:​
1. Establish the amount of interest for the period of the investment, and work out how much interest is earned per day​
2. Once we know how much was earned each day, we can multiply the answer by 365 to getthe amount of interest per year​
3. Once we have the interest per year, we can divide this amount by our initial investment to show us the implied yield.​
Let’s see if this works:​
Example: 2 (Implied Yield)​
An investment of R1000 turns into R1, 006.16​
Over an investment period of 45 Days​
What is the implied yield?​
​
How much Interest earned = 1,006.16 - 1000​
Interest = 6.16​
​
Step 1: Interest Per Day​
= 6.16 ÷ 45​
= 0.1369 per day​
​
Step 2: Interest Per Year​
= 0.1369 x 365​
= 49.96​
= 49.96 ÷ 1,000​
= 0.04996​
Thus rounded = 4.996% i.e. 5%​
​
The calculation above showed just how easy it is to work out the yields, or alternatively the implied yield when we know the beginning and ending values of an investment.​
​
The key point though is that our calculations already used the interest rate which captures our exact return. In other words, the yield is in fact our actual return​
​
We indicated earlier that some instruments are quoted as a yield and some as discounts. Let’s explore how the yield calculations are done when we invest in instruments quoted at a discount.
 

The Different Ways to Invest?​
Overview
At this stage, we have grown to understand a little more about what it takes to become an investor.​
​
A crucial step is how to actually invest your money. This module will help us to understand the different ways that you can invest your money in shares.​
​
You could decide that you would like to hand over full responsibility to a firm or person, or perhaps you could be the type of investor who likes to be hands on. Then again you could appreciate a bit of both. By the time we are done with this module, you should have a better idea of the avenues available to you in terms of investing your shares.
 
1. Stock Brokers 
A stock broker is a member of the JSE and is essentially an assistant and facilitator to your trading activities. They arrange transactions on your behalf so that you invest your shares in a way that results in a profitable return for you.​
​
You can select a brokerage firm that is aligned to your investing goals, educational needs and learning style. It is important, as a new investor, to select a stock broker that fits your needs. This is why you need to be clear about your investment goals as we discussed in previous modules.​
​
It is important to understand that the JSE is not going to buy or sell a share directly for you. Via the stockbrokers you will place your buy and sell orders where they will be executed in the market either by doing it yourself on the broker platforms or having the stockbroker executing the trade on your behalf.​
​
The JSE has about 60 listed regional members, and you can access these stockbroking facilities countrywide with most of them offering online trading facilities (https://www.jse.co.za/findastockbroker).  
​
2. Financial Advisors
Let's say you would like to retire in 15 years or send your child to a private tertiary institution in 12 years. To achieve your goals, you may need a skilled professional to help fulfill these plans, and that’s where a financial advisor comes in.​
​
You and your advisor will cover many areas, including how much money you should save, the types of accounts you need, the type of insurance you should have (including disability, long-term care, and term life), as well as tax and estate planning.​
​
The financial advisor is also an educator. Part of their role is to help you comprehend what is involved in reaching your future goals. The education process may involve thorough assistance with financial topics. At the start of your relationship, those topics could simply be saving and budgeting. As you progress in your knowledge, the advisor will help you understand complex investment, tax, and insurance matters. This can include what shares to invest in to meet your financial goals.
 
3. Financial Service Providers
Stockbrokers are different from financial service providers such as investment managers and insurance companies. A Financial Service Provider (FSP) is a business offering financial advice and/or go-between services (such as brokers and investment funds etc).​
​
Financial service providers usually offer an indirect means to invest in the equity markets. This indirect form of investment generally involves leaving the decisions about where to place money to the investment professionals. ​
​
In fact many financial service providers still require the services of a stockbroker in order to build their portfolios and buy or sell shares that they potentially manage on your behalf in these indirect forms.
 
4. DIY via a Stockbroker
This is when you choose to invest in shares yourself via a stock broker. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses – as well as how much time and effort you are willing to commit to charting your investment course – will put you in the best position to succeed.  It is important to remember that this does not mean you can invest directly yourself, but will always need to do so via a stock broker who provides you with a trading platform.​
​
To succeed in self-investment, it is important to remember the below:​

Make an assessment of where you currently stand in life e.g. age, your investment horizon, risk appetite etc.​
Know what you own in terms of shares, cash, property etc. You also need to know how much time you have to dedicate to the management of your shares which will help you determine how many shares to own.​
Assess the sources of information that are available to you in terms of share analysis e.g. press releases, earnings reports, cashflow statements etc.​
Draw up a strategy including the area of the market that interests you and specific shares, and how you can gain experience in managing these.​
Re-assess and adjust your strategy as you grow in your knowledge and understanding of shares. 







Who to Invest in and Where to Find Them​
Overview
The purpose of this module is to give you insight into accessing the list of companies that you are able to invest in as well as how to access their information in order to guide your investment decisions going forward.​
​
By the end of this module, you should have a grasp of the following questions: ​

Who am I able to invest in?​
How do I access their information?​
Who is the JSE?


Who to Invest In?
You have reached the point of your investment journey where you are ready to start investing. You have learnt about the basics of investment and the types of shares that you can buy, and now it is time to decide which companies you want to buy shares in. ​
​
Buying shares in a company is not as simple as just deciding on the company that you want to invest in. The companies you choose to invest in have to be publically listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) before any of their shares can be bought and traded.​
​
The names of the companies that are listed on the JSE can be found on the JSE website. Once you have had a look at the list, it is important that you understand the company and industry before taking the leap and buying shares in them. Accessing and looking at different company information that is available to current and potential shareholders is a great way to help guide your thinking when deciding which companies to invest in.

Accessing Company Information
Companies that are listed on the JSE have certain requirements that they need to meet in order to be and remain listed. One of these requirements is ensuring that both current and potential shareholders have access to relevant information such as:​

Financial performance, ​
Change in leadership/ directorship,​
Annual General Meeting (AGM) results/ feedback. ​

​
This information is made available on request. The information is usually accessed through each company's website via a dedicated investor section. Information is also accessible via printed media such as newspaper publications when applicable, such as the results of a company. 

Who is the JSE?
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) is the platform of choice for local and international investors looking to invest in companies and gain exposure to the leading capital markets in South Africa and the broader African continent. They offer investors access to a wide range of companies to invest in. This is all backed up by the regulatory services and post-trading support that the JSE offers to investors.​
​
The JSE was formed in 1887 during the first gold rush in South Africa. In 1963, after the first law that covered financial markets was passed in 1947, the JSE joined the World Federation of Exchanges and upgraded to an electronic trading system in the early 1990s. ​
​
In 2003, the JSE launched an alternative exchange, AltX, for small and mid-sized listings. They then bought the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) in 2001 and the Bond Exchange of South Africa (BESA) in 2009. Today, they offer access to five financial markets namely:​

Equities ​
Bonds​
Financial​
Commodity​
Interest Rate Derivatives





Functions of an Exchange
Overview
This module will introduce you to the systems that process your investments.​
​
You can expect to learn about:​
​

What a share exchange is​
The purpose of a share exchange​
The benefits of a share exchange​
The main share exchanges​
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)


What is a Share Exchange?
A share market is a market of shares - a place where buyers and sellers get together to exchange goods for cash. It is a market like any other market, such as a supermarket (e.g. Checkers or Spar) or a flea market. ​
​
A supermarket, for instance, is a place that offers goods from soup to sweets along with numerous other things for shoppers to buy. The share market is a recognized market where people (investors) can freely buy and sell shares issued by companies to other investors.​
​
Therefore, a share exchange is a place where buyers and sellers meet and decide on a price in order to exchange shares. ​
​
Certain exchanges are physical locations where you find that transactions are carried out on a trading floor. The other type of exchange is a virtual kind, made up of a network of computers where trades are made electronically (e.g. the JSE).

Purpose of a Share Exchange
Share exchanges clearly play a key role in this share market that you are immersing yourself in. They go beyond being important and are in fact the central force keeping the market together.​
​
Breaking it down into the key elements, here is a look at the two main functions of a stock exchange:​
​

 To help companies raise capital (funds) in the main market.​
To assist with the trading of shares (and other instruments) - in the secondary market.​

​
In other words they help bring a company to the share market and then help to trade its shares afterwards. The exchange helps with the ease of trade and this is why it is talked about as an ‘organized’ market.​
​
The exchange also provides price awareness of all listed shares. In other words as a shareholder you are always able to establish the current value of your share portfolio as you will be able to make certain what each share is currently priced at. In a nutshell, the purpose of a share market is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus reducing the risks of investing.

Benefits of a Share Exchange
Share exchanges operate under strict rules, regulations and guidelines.​
​
As the exchange has very stringent rules, regulations and guidelines for which companies can list, public shares are considered to be much safer compared to the unlisted or private kind.​
​
Furthermore, an exchange has certain legal responsibilities and ensures an orderly market by:​

Distributing information, ​
guaranteeing transactions on the exchange, ​
facilitating the clearing and settlement of transactions, and ​
protecting the interests of the investors.


Main Stock Exchanges
Stock exchanges operate all over the world and you may be familiar with a few of them. When shares are talked about who does not think of Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange. ​
​
It is probably the most recognizable of all the exchanges and is often seen in the media with the ringing of the NYSE bell at the start and end of each day. Other United States exchanges include the NASDAQ and the AMEX. ​
​
Then there is the London stock exchange (LSE). Asia has grown significantly in influence on the world stage with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).

The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE)
The Johannesburg Stock exchange was established in 1887 – over 125 years ago. It was born out of South Africa’s gold rush just one year after gold was discovered in Johannesburg and it was the key to our mining industry as it helped raise the capital required for businesses to flourish.​
​
This prestigious exchange was the cornerstone of business in central Johannesburg for more than 100 years. However, because of growth and technological changes it is now part of the financial hub based in Sandton.​
​
For most of the years in the Johannesburg city centre, shares were traded on the exchange using the open outcry system where all trades are matched, or buyers and sellers' transactions are executed through brokers, face to face, on the trading floor. ​
​
Today there is an electronic system that is used for traders to input the prices that they are willing to buy or sell at. The powerful computer system can execute thousands of trades per day.​
​
More than a setting for trading shares and bonds, the JSE stands tall as the engine room of the South African economy. Here, companies from across all industries and commerce gather to raise the public capital that will allow them to expand, in the process creating new jobs, products, services, and opportunities.




Trading vs Investing
Overview
Investing and trading are two very different methods of trying to profit in the financial markets. ​
​
Both investors and traders look for profits by participating in the financial markets. ​
​
In general, investors are after larger returns over a long period through buying and holding. Traders, by contrast, take advantage of both rising and falling markets to buy and sell shares over a shorter timeframe, taking smaller, more frequent profits.​
​
Investing is more of a marathon while trading can be viewed as a number of sprints.

Investing
The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth over a long period of time through the buying and holding of a portfolio of shares, baskets of shares, bonds, and other investment instruments.​
​
Investments often are held for a period of years, or even decades, taking advantage of the benefits of dividends along the way. While markets inevitably change, investors will "ride out" the downtrends with the hope that prices will bounce back and any losses eventually will be recovered. ​
​
Investors typically are more concerned with market essentials, such as price/earnings ratios and management forecasts.​
​
Anyone who has a pension fund  is investing, even if they are not tracking the performance of their holdings on a daily basis. Since the goal is to grow a pension fund over the course of decades, the day-to-day fluctuations are less important than consistent growth over an extended period.

Trading
Trading, on the other hand, involves more frequent transactions, such as the buying and selling of shares, commodities, currency, or other instruments. The goal is to make returns that outperform those of investing, which involves buying and holding of shares. ​
​
While investors may seek to try and achieve an annual return of  around 10% to 15%, traders seek a higher return than the average investor. Profits in trading are made by purchasing at a lower price and selling at a higher price within a fairly short period of time. The opposite is also true: profits in trading can be received by selling at a higher price and purchasing to cover at a lower price (also known as "selling short") to profit in falling markets.​
​
A trader's style refers to the timeframe or “holding period” in which shares, commodities, or other trading instruments are bought and sold. Traders generally fall into one of four categories:​

Position Trader: This trader holds positions from months to years.​
Swing Trader: This trader holds positions from days to weeks.​
Day Trader: This trader holds positions throughout the day only with no overnight positions.​
Scalp Trader: This trader holds positions for seconds to minutes with no overnight positions.​

​Traders regularly select their trading style based on factors including the amount of time they can dedicate to trading, account size, their level of trading experience, risk tolerance and personality.

In Summary

 Investing takes a long-term approach and often applies to such things as retirement accounts.​
Trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly.​
Investors are more likely to ride out short-term losses, while traders will attempt to make transactions that can help them profit quickly from fluctuating markets.​

Trading and investing both consist of pursuing profit in the share market, but they chase after that goal in different ways. ​
Traders often focus on a share’s technical factors rather than a company’s long-term prospects. What matters to traders is which direction the share will move next and how the trader can profit from that move. Investors have a longer-term outlook. They think in terms of years and often hold shares through the market’s ups and downs.​
​
Once you have decided on your investment strategy and goals, as well as your appetite for risk, you will be better able to tell if you want to invest or trade in shares.

 




JSE Financial Markets​
Overview
The JSE offers investors access to various financial markets namely:​

​Equities ​
Bonds​
Commodities​
Derivatives​

​
The aim of this module is to provide you with insight into the different JSE Markets to help guide your investment decisions.​
​
By the time you have completed this module, you should be able to answer the following question:​
​

Share Indices
Overview
The market is up, the market is down. Everyday we hear about the shares market on the news, radio, and in the paper. ​
​
What does it mean when they say: "The market turned in a great performance today"? What is "The Market" anyway? It turns out that most of the time when people are talking about "The Market" they are referring to an index. ​
​
With the growing importance of the shares market in our society, indices like the FTSE/ JSE All Share, DJIA, S&P 500, and Nasdaq combined have grown to become a part of our everyday vocabulary.​
​
In this module we're going to cover what an index is, go through some of the major share indices, and find out how we can invest in the share market using index funds.

What is an Index?
The basic definition of an index is that it is a guide or benchmark to how the market is performing.​
​
It would be too difficult to try and track every single security trading in the country. To get around this, we take a smaller sample of the market that represents the entire market. ​
​
Thus, just as pollsters use political surveys to measure the sentiment of the population, investors use indices to track the performance of the share market. Ideally a change in the price of an index would represent an exactly related change in the shares included in the index.

How Do You Calculate the Share Index?
The price of a share market index is calculated using a method called market cap weighting. ​
​
In this system, the weight of each security is calculated based in the total amount of shares issued.​
​
If a company’s market capitalization is R10,000,000 and the value of all shares in the index is R100,000,000, then the company would be worth 10% of the index (R10,000,000/R100,000,000). ​
These types of systems are made possible by computers, most are calculated by the minute and so are very accurate to the market.

What Are the Main Indices in the Local Market?
All Share Index​
The FTSE/JSE All Share index is the main index of the local share market. It consist of companies that represent roughly the largest 99% of the companies listed on the main board of the JSE by market capitalization and is the largest index in terms of size and overall value. ​
ALSI 40 Index​
These are the top 40 largest companies listed on the JSE by investable market capitalization. The FTSE/JSE All Share 40 Top Companies Index (ALSI 40 Index) is an equity index and is the index that most people monitor as an overall benchmark for the local exchange. ​
A relatively small quantity of the total number of securities listed on the JSE are combined into the index on the basis that movements in the share prices of those essential companies can be said to represent the movement of the market as a whole. ​
Companies selected for inclusion in the ALSI 40 Index are generally larger companies with widely traded and marketable shares (e.g. MTN, Sasol, Shoprite etc).
MidCap Index​
The FTSE/JSE Mid Cap Index will represent 85%-96% of the market capital  value of all companies listed on the Main Board of the JSE. ​
​
Other Indicators​
There is also a resources index, financial index and an industrial index:​

The financial index includes shares such as banks. e.g. Standard Bank​
The resource index is made up of resource shares e.g. BHP Billiton​
The industrial index is made up of industrial companies. e.g. Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA


 




Market Capitalisation
Overview
Market capitalization should be a familiar term to you by now.​
​
You would have been introduced to it under the module, “Compiling Your Investment Portfolio”. ​
​
In this module, we will delve a little deeper into the different sizes of market capitalization and how this affects your investments. We will also consider some misconceptions around market capitalization as a measure of a company’s worth.

Defining Market Capitalisation
Market Capitalisation refers to the total Rand value of a company’s outstanding shares. Since a company is represented by X number of shares, multiplying X with the per share price represents the total rand value of the company. Outstanding shares signify the shares of a company presently held by all its shareholders, including institutional investors’ share blocks as well as restricted shares owned by the officers and insiders of the company.​
​
Market capitalisation=Outstanding shares x Share price​
​
Therefore if a company has issued 1,000,000 shares and they are each valued at R20 then the market capitalisation of the company is R20,000,000.​
​
A common mistaken belief is that the share price indicates how big the company is. This is not necessarily true. For example, company A could have a higher share price of R100 per share in comparison to company B that has a share price of R20 per share, but company A may only have 1 million shares while company B has 10 million shares. In effect, company A would have a market value of R100 million while company B is valued at R200 million.

Market Capitalisation Ranking
Market capitalisation is a useful tool to determine which shares you are interested in, and how to diversify your portfolio with companies of different sizes.​
​
Large cap companies are recognized as the JSE Top 40 and have market caps of hundreds of billions of Rands.​
​
These big companies have typically been around for a while, and they are major players in well-founded industries. Investing in large-cap companies does not essentially give massive returns in a short period of time, but in the long-term, these companies could increase in share value and reward shareholders with dividend payments.​
​
Examples of large cap companies are Discovery, Aspen Pharmacare, and Shoprite to name a few.
Mid-cap companies  ​
Mid-cap companies are companies that are reputable and function in an industry projected to experience quick growth. Mid-cap companies are in the process of expanding. They are attractive for their growth potential. Examples of mid-cap companies are Clicks, Barloworld and Spar amongst others.​
Small-cap companies ​
The companies that are considered small cap companies are those that are the next biggest after mid-cap companies. These companies are considered higher risk investments due to the markets they serve and their size. Smaller companies with smaller share price values are riskier due to the spread, which represents the difference in the supply and demand of a share. A high demand for shares drives up the price of shares whereas a low demand drives down the price of shares. It is this difference that is shown by this spread. What makes this risky for small cap companies with smaller share values is that even small shifts in share value can make a big difference in the overall value of the share.

Small-cap Market Spread Example
A small cap technology company's current share price is R20 per share. They release a new smartphone that becomes very popular in the market. This drives up the share price to R50 per share, increasing the value by R30 per share from the original share price. The increase in share value can be calculated by subtracting the original share price from the new share price: R50 – R20 = R30. This increase in share value was caused by a rise in demand for the shares as more people look to invest in the company.​
A few months later, the smartphones start breaking and the company has a huge wave of returns and replacements to deal with. This scandal causes investors to start selling their shares which makes the price of the shares drop from R50 per share to R25 per share. That is a decrease in value of R25, which in this case is 50% of the share price before the smartphones started breaking. This decrease in share value was caused by a drop in the demand for the shares because of all of the problems the company was facing with their most popular product. ​
This example shows a very big rise and drop in share value for small cap company due to the supply and demand of the shares. A big change in value like this is known as a large spread.  ​
The same changes in price for a mid – large cap company will not have as much of an effect on the overall share value as it does with a small cap company because their shares are worth more and can therefore withstand a higher spread than small cap companies. ​
For example, a R25 shift in share price for a company whose shares sell for R1200 will not have as much of an impact as it does for a company whose shares sell for R20. This comparison shows the higher risk with investing in small-cap companies as a small change in share price can have a bigger effect on the overall share value than it would with a mid – large cap company.

Misconceptions About Market Capitalisation
Although it is frequently used to describe a company, market cap does not measure the equity value of a company. Only a detailed analysis of the fundamentals of a company can do that. ​
​
Market cap is insufficient to value a company because the market price on which it is founded does not necessarily reveal how much a piece of the business is worth. Shares are regularly over- or undervalued by the market, which means that the market price regulates only how much the market is willing to pay for its shares. ​
​
Although market cap measures the cost of buying all of the shares of a company, it does not govern the amount the company would cost to obtain in a merger transaction. ​
​
Two main factors can alter the market cap of a company: key changes in the share price or when a company issues or repurchases shares. An investor who exercises a large number of securities can also increase the amount of shares on the market and negatively affect shareholders in a process known as dilution. 

 

The Wealth Creation Process​
Overview
This module is your first step in understanding where investment fits into your financial life and at what point it is a good idea to start saving and investing.​
By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:​

What is the Wealth Creation Process?​
What are sources of income?​
When do you start saving?​
When do you start investing?​
	 

The Wealth Creation Process
The wealth creation process is the journey that a person follows to build their personal wealth over time. Wealth creation is about making sure that you make enough money to pay for your bills and expenses, and also put money aside for the future. Growing personal wealth is an important part of making sure that you are financially stable so that you can cover all expenses, and have money to put towards your future goals such as owning a nice house or sending your kids to university.​
Before you can start to build your personal wealth, you need to make sure that you have the following 3 things in place:
Making sure that you have money to save and invest is the first step in the wealth creation process. You should strive to create a habit around saving money each month, or each time you receive it, in order to create a pool of savings for the future or to use that money for investing.​
It is also never a good idea to take a loan out in order to invest as there is no guarantee that you will have enough money at the end to pay back your loan.
 
Sources of Income
​Having an income means that you have a source of money coming into your bank account.  ​
There are 2 types of income that a person can make: ​
Earned income: Earned income includes the taxable income you get for work that you have done either as an employee or an entrepreneur, and is your first source of money in the wealth creation process.  ​
Passive income: Passive income comes from the money earned with minimal activity such as investments. It is possible to earn further down the wealth creation process line once you have sources of income and savings in place. ​
When making income from your job or self-employment, there are a few important things to think about and plan for to make sure that you maximize your income source:​

Is this work something that you can see yourself doing for the next 20 years?​
Is there work you can do or a business that you can start that is in line with your talents and interests?​
What will your earned income look like in the future?​
How much do you need to earn to meet your needs and save long-term?​
What education and training do you need to do well in your job and/or business?​

It is important to put aside some money every month when your source of income comes in, so as to build a habit of saving and investing in your journey of wealth creation. ​
 
Save Money
Saving money is easier said than done. You may make enough money to cover your expenses but you are still not saving enough at the end of each month. Why does this happen? ​
People find it difficult to save when their needs and wants cost more than what they earn. The most important step to take when saving is deciding what you really need and what you want but don’t need eg: school fees (need) vs a new jacket (want). ​
Finding simple ways to save money starts off with creating a decent budget so that you have a good idea of what you can or can't do with your money when it comes in. Saving money doesn’t stop with making a budget and sticking to it, other means could be as simple as shopping on sales days and turning your geyser off when you aren’t using it. These small savings can help to keep your expenses down and give you some extra money to start growing your savings stash.  ​
Deciding on how big you want your savings to be has a lot to do with your current and future needs and goals. A good measure to keep in mind is having a savings of 3 – 6 months' worth of your earned income as a safety net in case something unexpected happens.​
Another good system you could develop in becoming a saver is deciding on a percentage of your earned income to save each month or when it comes into your bank account. For instance, you could decide to start off saving 5% of your earned income and you can choose to grow this percentage as time goes and your needs and goals shift.
 
Invest Money
We’ve spoken about having enough money and about savings, now what about investing your money as part of the wealth creation process? Investing is about putting money into an asset or an endeavour (such as a business or project) for a medium-long period of time (5 years or more) with the expectation that the money will earn more money or profit without you being able to use it on day-to-day living such as with a bank. ​
​
The money that you invest is not for you to use on expenses, bills, and wants that you have now. It is for you to put aside to grow so that when you do get the money, it can help you buy a big reward like a car or house, or your child’s education. It is about investing in your future. 
There are many ways to go about investing your money and many types of investments out there for people to get involved in. It is important for you to learn about trading, investing, and what kind of investor you are before diving in and investing all of your money without having enough information to get the most out of your investments.
 




The Mind of an Investor​
Overview
This module will lead us to understand how investors think. It aims to highlight the attitudes and mindsets we can adopt in order to become wise investors.​
​
As we learnt in the previous module, investing is a long-term journey rather than one of instant rewards. Let us take the time to understand how to make our future financial goals a priority.​
​
By the time you have completed this module, you should have a better understanding of the kind of mindset you need in order to shape your long-term investment journey.
 
Set Goals
An investor first understands why they are investing their money and the result they desire in the long-run from doing so. This is called having financial goals.​
​
It may be worthwhile to ask yourself vital questions such as:​

What are your intentions for the funds that you would like to invest? ​
Is safety as the main goal with some degree of return adequate? ​
Is your objective to accumulate money for a longer-term goal such as a tertiary education for your children or maybe a more secure retirement for yourself? ​

​You may even have various investments for different goals. Remember to create these goals with an understanding of how much risk you can handle and your time horizon.
 
Understand Your Level of Knowledge
It is vital for an investor to understand what they do and don’t know. They should never be talked into investing in something that they are not comfortable with or do not understand. ​
​
Some investment vehicles need advanced knowledge and observation, while others are much simpler and allow you to just invest and go. Your investment decisions need to be established on your level of comfort and your willingness to dedicate time to investigating your choices. ​
​
The key is to continually work on improving your level of knowledge through vehicles (tools) such as books, internet research, seminars and workshops which will assist you in improving your investment knowledge in order to make better investment decisions.
 
Avoid Panic
Panic is an emotion that causes us to make irrational decisions - to sell a share when it should be held, or to buy a share when perhaps it should be sold. ​
​
The reality is that we are not able to stop our emotions from rising, including panic, but we can learn to control them. You can learn to use the emotion of panic to lead you to do more thorough research and to become a better investor.​
​
Finally, try to take bad market news in your stride and make sure you have analyzed a situation properly before acting. If you choose to delay an investment decision by even a few minutes, your thought process can become noticeably clearer.
 
Consider Short-term Wins
Investors are encouraged to invest for the long-term but they need to consider the possibility that certain events could positively or negatively impact their investment. They need to use that information to help them in making a decision of when to buy.​
​
For the sake of an example we are going to consider the investment decisions made by an investor buying in to a fictional gold mining company, AU.​
A long-term investor bought shares in AU in early 2005 because the shares looked "cheap". What they didn’t consider was the near-term risks that come with strikes that were happening at the time and how the break in production would affect the share price of AU. The investor ended up losing 50% of the value of their investment within a year. ​
Had that same investor considered what was happening in the mining industry and waited until the shares leveled off in the spring of 2006 before buying in, his or her investment would have been up about 30% by the end of the year.​
​
An investor, therefore, keeps in mind the possibility of short-term catalysts that could impact shares.
 
Understanding Your Risk Appetite
It is important for investors to understand what risks they are willing to take in their wealth creation journey. You should have a realistic understanding of your ability and willingness to handle large changes in the value of your investments. If you take on enormous risk, you may panic and sell at an inopportune time. The following questions can assist in deciding the risks an investor is willing to take:​

What products am I going to invest in? For example, single stock options vs FTSE/JSE Top 40. It would be useful to get an idea of the worst-case returns that different products have had in the past so you can decide how much money you would be willing to lose if you invested in a certain product and it had a period of bad performance.​
What products am I willing to lose or let go of should the need arise?​
How long am I willing to sit in a losing position when my investment seems to be faltering? Will I ride it out or pull out?​

​
It is important for an investor to know when to cut their losses. ​
​
An investor needs to always have a position to fall back on whether it is deciding on the maximum percentage drop in value of their shares below purchase price that they are willing to take. They should also always have a way out of an investment position or a way to understand and reduce their risk.




Are You Ready to Invest?​
Overview
The purpose of this module is to give you an introduction to investing and to help you decide whether or not you want to start investing.​
​
By the time you have completed this module, you should be able to answer the following questions:​

What is investing?​
Is investing for me?​
What basics do I need to know before I invest?​
What does it mean for me to be investment ready?


What is Investing?
Investing is when you invest in an asset, e.g. a share, so that hopefully over time, the share grows and you make money. It is important to note that there is no guarantee that you will make money or profit from your investments.​
​
Investing means that you decide to not spend your money on things that give instant gratification – like a new outfit or lounge set, or even a night out or make-up. Instead, you put your financial future before your current wants by buying medium-long term assets. ​
​
Investing takes time and allows you to build true wealth. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme.

Is Investing for Me?
It is important to take a moment to consider your current situation in life to help you decide whether investing is for you. Doing so will help you understand your current financial position and what size risks you are willing to take.​
 
6 Things to consider before you invest:​
 

Income stream – evaluating and understanding your income stream will help to inform your investment decisions such as when or what to invest in.​
	 
What is your current financial position – do you still have a lot of debt that you need to pay off? Do you have some savings/extra cash that you can use to invest? You can decide if your money still needs to be used elsewhere or if you have the funds to invest now.
	 
Standard of living – what do you need to have a comfortable and enjoyable life including personal belongings, holidays, entertainment and luxury items? Are you comfortable now? Are you able to budget? Once you have established the money that is needed for the life you want you can then decide how much money you need for investing.​
	 
Personal control – how much control do you like to have in managing your finances? Would you rather let someone do it for you or do you like to know what is happening with your money?​

Insurance – do you have enough insurance against risks to your property, possessions, income and well-being? This helps you understand if you can use your extra money for investing or if you still need to take care of these responsibilities.


Need for financial independence – do you have a strong need to not rely on a pension fund? Investing may be an option for you to become financially independent.
	 


What Does it Mean to be Investment Ready?
In order for you to be prepared to invest your money, it would be useful to carry out the following 5 exercises:​

 Draw up a personal balance sheet by listing your assets (resources) and liabilities (bills) to determine your net worth (value of everything you own). ​
 Analyze your balance sheet and try to identify any changes you can make to increase your wealth e.g. can you replace a depreciating asset (an asset losing value) with appreciating assets – instead of 2 DVD systems you can sell one and invest that money.
 Begin to grow funds for you to invest e.g. sell some assets and reinvest that money; change jobs; lower your debt payments; get a side job to make extra cash; or cut down on expenses.​
Develop and/or maintain a positive cashflow where cashflow is a result of the money that is coming in (income) and the money that is being spent (outflows). The result will either be positive or negative cashflow depending on how well you manage your cash.​
Have a clear understanding of your long-term, medium-term and short-term financial goals.

NB: It is suggested that you speak to a financial advisor to ​
assess the above if you do not have the objectivity or ​
knowledge to do so.

 




Things to Consider When Investing​
Overview
How do you know which company or which shares are the best to invest in? ​
There are two main paths that investors can follow in deciding on which shares to select. ​
​
This is the question that this module essentially seeks to answer. There are a few basics that can assist an investor in determining the best place to put their money. You have probably worked hard to make the money you are investing and you will want to be wise in where you put it.​
​
It is wise to know and understand which shares you have bought, what they are worth and why you are holding them.

Analysing a Company
There are two paths you can take to determine the performance of a company or share which will then assist you in deciding on which shares to invest in.​
​
Technical Analysis​
This is when you look at the price history of a company by analysing charts and graphs. You can hand-draw these charts or put them together on a computer. It is important to note that you don't have to buy software in order to do technical analysis. You can use free charts that are on the internet or that you can get from brokers.​
​
Fundamental Analysis​
This is when you look at the company's cashflow statement, balance sheet, and the value of the shares amongst other ratios. You can also engage the management of the company as well as company news to gain a clearer picture of its performance.​
​
As an investor, you will need to decide whether you will make use of either or both analytical techniques in order to determine the value of the company you want to invest in. Alternatively, you can decide to buy a basket of shares and not engage in these analyses. ​
​
In this module, we will consider the fundamental analysis approach.

Fundamental Analysis: Research the Company
Good investors search for all material information about a company to assist them in deciding on whether to invest in their shares. Gathering company information is like turning over all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle before starting to hunt for matching pieces. ​
​
This may seem to be a boring task, but you are able to make better decisions with all the facts before you. It is advisable to start with an industry or a company that you know or that you think is a good or popular one, and that you believe provides great services or products to the public or community at large.​
​
A company to own, after all, is one that you believe in.
 
1. Basic Company Information
An investor needs to begin by searching for basic information about the company they are considering to invest in.​
This includes the industry the company operates in and the actual business they are engaged in. It is also useful to find out about the company’s management, their vision and strategy for the firm, and the company’s competitors. Engaging in this research will help you decide on the legitimacy and health of the company and their business, and whether this is a suitable place to put your hard-earned money.
 
2. Company News
It is helpful to get information about how the company performs outside of what the company itself says. This would mean reading the newspaper and financial magazines to get insight into external views about your business of interest.​
Companies also commonly give non-earnings-related press releases on business developments throughout the year. These cover anything and everything. ​
Companies must report measurable business developments to the public as events arise. So every new business contract, acquisition, change in management or anything else, is released to the public at random via press release.
 
Fundamental Analysis: Where to Find Information

a.  Company Website - A great place to start is by going to the company’s official website where you should be able to begin your journey of understanding the company. This should include their corporate profile, the product and services they offer and so much more.​


b.  Brokers – When you invest through your broker, you will have access to your own professional market analyst. Brokers spend hours putting information together and researching market insight from the different business sectors. Remember, though, that advice received from your broker to buy a share is just that, advice. The final decision must lie with you.​


c.  Financial/Business Newspapers – These will keep you in touch with the economic environment, which is important to the performance of any company but it also provides you with the key information to help you understand the company’s performance better. Newspapers will also provide you with information about the industry that your potential company operates in.​


d.  Google – You can find almost anything online these days which means that you can search for information you would like to understand about a company or share. Remember to make use of reliable sources though.​


e.  Financial Portals – There are many good financial websites on the internet that have valuable information on companies, such as the JSE. 


Technical Analysis
Technical Analysis is based on the use of charts that provide investors with the price history of a company, which helps to get an idea of the performance of that company. The tools that are available to you to engage in technical analysis include:​

​Brokers and financial websites that offer you access to technical charts for free. There is charting software that is sold but you do not need to buy this software as brokers and the financial websites provide free charts. ​
Conducting the technical analysis yourself. Companies do offer charting software in order for you to analyse companies. This is software that you can purchase, however, it is not imperative to have this software in order to be able to conduct your own technical analysis.​
Using data to draw charts by hand by reading the newspapers and getting the company's closing price, and plotting this price each day on graph paper. There are different charts that you can draw using the data you gather including line charts, bar charts, and scatter plot charts among others. The most common one is a line chart which basically joins the price from one to the next and creates a picture of the direction that the share is going. 


 




What it Means to be an Investor​
Overview
In this module, we are going to debunk the myths around owning shares and clarify what being an investor entitles you to.​
​
Most people realize that owning a share means that you are buying a percentage of ownership in the company, but many new investors have mistaken beliefs about the benefits and responsibilities of being a shareholder. ​
​
Many of these mistaken beliefs come from a lack of understanding of the amount of ownership that each share represents. We aim to help you gain a better understanding of this with this module.

Rights of an Investor
Holding a company's share means that you are one of the many shareholders of a company, and, as such, should the company choose to pay out dividends you will receive the set dividend based on the amount of shares you own.​
​
As an owner, you are entitled to vote at annual meetings. However, it does not mean that you are the boss at the company in which you are invested. As a shareholder of a public company, you do not necessarily have a say in the day to-day running of the business. ​
​
For instance, as a shareholder in Microsoft, you cannot necessarily call up Bill Gates and give him your opinion of how you believe the company should be run. 
The management at a company is meant to increase the value of the firm for shareholders. Should this not take place, the shareholders can vote for the management to be removed. ​
​
Profits are occasionally distributed in the form of dividends. As your share ownership increases, so does the portion of the profits you get. ​
​
In terms of your claim on assets in the company, this is only relevant if a company goes bankrupt. In case of bankruptcy, the shareholders will receive what's left after all the creditors have been paid should there be anything left to pay out at all. 

Limited Liability
An extremely important feature of shares is their limited liability, which means that, as an owner of a share, you are not personally responsible if the company is not able to pay its debts. ​
​
In some instances, certain businesses such as partnerships are set up so that if the partnership goes bankrupt the creditors can come after the partners (shareholders) in their personal capacity and sell off their furniture, house, car etc. ​
​
Owning shares means that, no matter what, the maximum value you can lose is the value of your investment i.e. the funds (including any growth) you invest in the company. Even if a company where you hold shares goes bankrupt, you can never lose your personal assets.

 




Determining the Value of a Company​
Overview
At this point in your investment journey, you have been encouraged to do some homework on the company whose shares you are considering investing in.​
​
Your research should help you to establish that the company in which you are investing is growing and is financially sound. You want to know that the company operates in a strong and growing industry and that it offers services and products which are desirable to the consuming public.​
​
This naturally begs the question of how exactly to determine whether the company is in fact doing well, and more importantly, that it is expected to continue doing so.​
​
This will be the focus of this module. We will share some of the documents or principles that will help clarify the value of a potential company.

Financial Statements
The process of getting to know a company’s financial condition through studying its balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement is known as fundamental analysis.​
​
The financial statements are made up of:​
​
Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position): This is used to work out a company’s net worth. It measures what the company has minus what they owe.​
​
Income Statement (Statement of Comprehensive Income): used to figure out a company’s profitability. It is the profit and loss account statement that records how much money or profit the business has generated over a period of time (Profit/Income = Sales – Expenses).

Financial Ratios
Financial ratios are used to determine how well the company is actually doing. They are helpful tools to identify relationships between two or more figures found in the financial statements.​
​
Earnings Per Share (EPS): This is generally considered to be the single most important fraction in determining a share’s price. It measures the portion of the business’s profits that are allocated to each ordinary share that is outstanding and helps to calculate the return on your investment.​
​

Earnings per share=(Net Income )/(Number of shares)​

​
Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): The earnings per share (EPS) are used to calculate the price to earnings ratio. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price in relation to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also identified as the earnings multiple or price multiple. P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to decide the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison.  This means doing a comparison of the PE ratios between companies in the same sector, such as Pick n Pay and Shoprite both found in the retail sector.​
 

Price to Earnings =(Share price)/​(Earnings per share)
 

Book Value vs Market Value
You can determine the value of a company by considering their book value and market value.​
​
Book value literally means the value of a business according to its books (accounts) that is revealed through its financial statements. ​
​
In theory, book value represents the total amount a company is worth if all its assets are sold and all the liabilities are paid back. This is the amount that the company’s creditors and investors can expect to receive if the company is closed down.​

Book value of a company=Total assets−Total liabilities​

Market value signifies the value of a company according to the share market. While market value is a general term that represents the price an asset would get in the marketplace, it represents the market capitalization in the context of companies. ​
​
It is the total market value of a company represented as a rand amount. Market value or market cap is calculated by multiplying a company's unpaid shares by its current market price.​

Market capitalisation of a company = Current market price (per share)





How to Read Financial Results​
Overview
A company's annual report is the most vital way for potential investors to understand the financial state of a company. ​
​
A company annual report is also a marketing tool designed to attract investors, and a company will try to present themselves in the best light possible without violating any legal regulations. Unfortunately, while many investors read annual reports, they fail to read them successfully. ​
​
In other words, while annual reports do not deceive or reflect false information about the business, investors should always read them with a sense of doubt. Learn how to read between the lines and make out the actual condition of the company.​
​
This module will assist you as an investor to learn how to make the most sense out of a company’s financial results.

Before Reading the Financial Statements
The more you read financial statements/integrated reports, the more comfortable you will become with the presentation, and the better able you will be to interpret what the statements are telling you. Most of the numbers in the financial statements don’t stand alone.​
​
Each financial statement will have several footnotes that strengthen the numbers – make sure you read these carefully. It’s also important to remember that to get a good feel for the company, you should look at it within a much larger context.​
​
Some of the things you need to consider before reading the financial statements or integrated report include:​
​
Perspective: Put the company into a context that includes its industry, the economy, interest rates, the business cycle, etc. For example, the financial statements and ratios of a basic material company such as Sasol are hugely different from that of a retailer such as Pick n Pay.​
​
Trends: Look at the company’s own trends or how it has performed over the past three, five or 10 years. You might find that this year’s performance is much better, or worse, than the performance over the past few years. If so, look for reasons – it may be that a company that supplies animal feed suffered a downturn during the drought.
As you are reading the financial statements of a company, remember that public companies produce two types of numbers: unaudited and audited.​
​

Unaudited: Unaudited numbers are sometimes called management figures. They are produced for executives and managers for specific purposes, such as inventory control and cash flow projections.​

​

Audited*: This is where an independent auditing firm (e.g. Ernst & Young) has reviewed the numbers to provide assurance that certain procedures have been followed so that the numbers follow accounting principles i.e. so that the numbers you are reading correctly show the state of the company.​

​
The three financial statements that you will come across are the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We will now consider what you need to look for in each of these.​
​
*Please note that not all numbers that are released to the public by companies have been reviewed by outside auditors. 
 
Income Statement
The income statement shows what the company makes in profits or losses during the reporting period, such as a quarter or a year. ​
​
The key information for you to look for in the income statement include the likes of:​

Revenue​
Headline Earnings​
Cost of Goods Sold​
Gross Profit​
Operating Expenses​
Other Revenues or Expenses​
Income Taxes​
Net Income​
Earnings Per Share (EPS)​

These topics go beyond the scope of this module and you would need to do your own research to understand them better.
 
Balance Sheet
This is a snapshot of the company’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity on the last day of the reporting period. ​
​
The left side of the balance sheet lists the assets (i.e what the company owns). The right side lists the liabilities (i.e. what the company owes), and the shareholders’ equity (i.e. the funds invested in the company and retained earnings). The two sides must balance, so the balance sheet format is assets equal liabilities plus shareholders’ equity (A = L + E).​
​
The balance sheet displays data from the two most recent years, which lets you calculate changes from one year to another. Major changes in any account must be examined and could be worth following up. ​
​
These are the items to look for on a balance sheet:​

​Current assets​
Cash (and cash equivalents)​
Accounts Receivables ​
Inventories​
Accounts Payable​
Accrued Expenses/Liabilities​
Preference Shares​
Retained/Reinvested Earnings​

​
These topics go beyond the scope of this module and you would need to do your own research to understand them better.




Tax Implications Linked to Investing​
Overview
Investment in shares comes with responsibilities in as much as it has its rewards.​
​
Part of that responsibility is in the tax paid on investments. A recent product that has come onto market in South Africa is a tax-free savings account in the form of ETFs which we cover in another module.​
​
This module will seek to offer information on the different types of taxes you may incur when investing in shares and how they impact your money.​
​
Remember, the JSE is not a tax expert. You should consult SARS or an accountant for deeper insights into the topic.​

First Things First: VAT & STT
The first tax you will pay as an investor is value-added tax (VAT) on brokerage and STRATE* fees when buying securities. ​
​
You also pay securities transfer tax (STT) of 0.25% on the invested amount when buying shares. Then there is also dividend withholding tax of 20% on all dividends paid by local companies. ​
​
There is another fee you pay when buying and selling and that is Investor Protection Levy (0.0002% on the transactions value) which is paid to finance insider-trading investigations (Please note that this Investor Protection Levy is a fee and not a tax).​
​
*STRATE is the electronic settlement service used in South Africa for share transactions. STRATE Settlement Costs are calculated as 0.005787% of the transaction value (minimum of R10.19 and maximum of R73.49)

Paying Tax on Profits and Shares
Please consult a tax advisor with regards to paying tax on profits of your shares for both income and capital gains tax.​

Dividend Tax
For equities (apart from listed property companies), you will incur dividend withholding tax (DWT) on the dividend income that is paid out. ​
​
DWT of 20% is held back from your dividends before they are paid out or reinvested.  Note the DWT is payable only on dividends paid out by the company and is payable after the company has already paid 28% corporate tax on its net profits. 

 




Dividends & Capital Growth​
Overview
As an investor in shares, you face a number of responsibilities and risks, but there are also some benefits that you receive.​
​
The idea behind investing is that you can gain profit from the funds you have chosen to put in certain shares in the near or distant future. In order to profit from your investments, you need to be aware of the different ways this can happen.​
​
This module will offer brief insight into two avenues of profit available to you as an investor, namely, dividends and capital growth.

Dividends
A dividend or a cash payout to share investors, isn’t just a source of income, it’s a sign of a company in good financial health. ​
​
Dividends are cash distributions that many companies pay out regularly from earnings to shareholders. They send a clear, powerful message about future prospects and performance. ​
​
The willingness and ability of a company to pay stable dividends over time – and its power to increase them – offer good clues about its fundamentals.​
​
Usually, mature, profitable companies pay dividends. Nevertheless, if companies do not pay dividends it does not necessarily mean they are without profits. If a company believes that it offers healthier growth opportunities compared to investment opportunities available to shareholders elsewhere, it often holds back the profits and reinvests them into the business. ​
​
For these reasons, few "growth" companies pay dividends. However, even mature companies still need to hold back enough cash to fund business activity and handle unforeseen events, even if much of their profits may be distributed as dividends.

Dividend Yields
It is even better to pay attention to how the dividend yield has behaved over time. The dividend yield is a measure of how much income is received in proportion to the share price.​
​
You calculate the dividend yield by dividing the dividend received over the last 12 months into the share price. ​

Dividend Yield= (Annual dividends per share)/(Price per share)​

Shares with higher dividend yields tend to be more attractive to the income investor because they result in better rates of return. ​
​
If the dividend paid per share is increasing but the share price is falling, this may be a signal that the market doesn’t believe that the business will be able to maintain the higher dividends. An increasing dividend yield may be cause for concern. ​
​
However, if the dividend yield is rising along with a rising share price trend then this can be taken as a healthy sign.

Capital Growth
Capital growth, also known as capital appreciation, is a rise in the value of an asset or investment over time. ​
​
Capital growth is the difference between the current share value and its purchase price at the time it was bought.​

Capital Growth = Current Share Value – Share Purchase Price​

The degree of capital growth that's advantageous depends on the investor and the investment objectives. The investment objectives differ among investors, depending on their level of risk tolerance. ​
​
Investors with low-risk tolerance are likely to seek income, while investors with high-risk tolerance are likely to seek capital growth.
Capital gains are entirely different from return in that they are only realized when the share is sold for a price that is higher than the price at which it was originally purchased. (Selling at a lower price is described as a capital loss.) ​
​
Therefore, investors looking for capital gains are not likely to be those individuals who need a fixed, ongoing source of investment returns from their portfolio, but rather, those who seek the possibility of longer-term growth.​
​
Capital growth is mostly realized through the purchase of ordinary shares, mainly growth shares, which offer low profits but great opportunity for increase in value. ​
​
For this reason, growth shares are considered to be some of the most speculative of investments as their return depends on what will happen in an unpredictable future. 




Compiling Your Investment Portfolio​
Overview
At this stage you have gained a better understanding of what shares are and how you can begin to invest in and benefit from them.​
​
Part of the process of investing is putting together an investment portfolio. This step is vital as it helps you to manage the risk linked to investment.​
​
This module will identify the steps you can take in putting together an investment portfolio so as to manage your investment risk.

Cautious and Aggressive Investors
As mentioned before, investing is all about the balance between risk and return and you  were asked to consider some of the factors that influence your risk appetite. If investors were to be grouped into two broad categories with regard to risk appetite, cautious and aggressive investors would be described as follows:​
​
Cautious Investor: is typically one who is more focused on moderate returns which have a higher chance of being realized. This type of investor is most interested in what is safe, secure or tried and tested. They understand that their lower appetite for risk has an impact on their expected return and are prepared to skip some of the superior rewards for more certainty.​
​
Aggressive Investor: usually has a much higher pain threshold – they are more comfortable with high levels of risk. They can afford to or are prepared to risk much more and as a result of this they stand to reap the big rewards. They also have to brace themselves for the downside of the risks they take.​
​
Once an investor is clear on their investment goals and risk appetite, there are numerous shares listed on the JSE that match specific investor goals and risk preferences. It is useful for you to decide which type of investor you are before putting your portfolio together.

Picking Shares: Size & Market Cap
There are a variety of ways in which shares can be classified – on the basis of size; on the basis of track record and solid earnings; or on the basis of industry.​
 
Size and Market Capitalization​
Regarding size, shares are commonly referred to as small, mid and large cap shares. ‘Cap’ is short for capitalisation. ​
​
Market Capitalisation is determined by multiplying the current market price of a share by the number of that company’s shares issued. This means that if a company has issued 1,000,000 shares and they are each valued at R20 then the market capitalisation of the company is R20,000,000.​
​
A common mistaken belief is that the share price indicates how big the company is. This is not necessarily true. For example, company A could have a higher share price of R100 per share in comparison to company B that has a share price of R20 per share, but company A may only have 1 million shares while company B has 10 million shares. In effect, company A would have a market value of R100 million while company B is valued at R200 million.
Market capitalisation is important to consider as an investor because it gives insights into a company’s potential for growth as well as their propensity for risk. ​
​
Small cap companies have traditionally experienced much higher growth potential but they tend to face more risks than large cap companies. Large caps usually experience lower capital growth but also experience more stable share prices or less price risk.​
​
It must be noted that a company’s market cap is not a constant number – it changes as the share price changes (remember the calculation for market cap).

Picking Shares: Market Sectors & Industries
Out of all the companies listed on the JSE, most belong to the Financial, Resources and Industrial sectors.​
​
There are too many companies listed on the JSE to provide a complete outline of which sector each company falls into.​
​
Recognizing who the market leaders are across the different sectors and industries helps you as an investor when trying to pick shares to invest in. ​
​
Some investors take the approach of first understanding the economy better rather than the individual businesses. When they look for opportunities they start by getting a bigger picture of the economy and current conditions.
They then investigate which sector or industry may be best positioned in the current economy to benefit and grow or thrive in that environment. When they have spotted a sector, they identify a company or specific share to buy. This is often called the “top down” approach to picking shares.​
​
Remember that past performance is not always a reliable indicator of future performance, but it may provide a benchmark of what to look for. ​

Diversification
Diversification is a method that many investors use to reduce the risk in their portfolio as a whole.​
​
One of the best ways to diversify is to make ensure that a portfolio consists of shares in a variety of sectors and not shares of different companies that are all within the same sector. For instance, investing in shares in Mr Price, and The Foschini Group would be investing in different companies but within the retail sector alone.​
​
Taking this concept one step further suggests that investors should not put all their money into one asset class. Shares form part of one type of asset class (in the equities market) – other asset classes include bonds (fixed-income financial instruments), money markets (cash or cash equivalents) and commodities (like gold, platinum and oil).​
​
Spreading investments across different asset classes is referred to as asset allocation, which involves finding the right mix or balance of each. Asset allocation can add to a diversified portfolio and enable the investor to match their needs even better.​
​
A diversified investment portfolio may well have investments in all three asset classes – the proportions of investments in each asset class (that is, the weighting) would depend on the investor’s risk appetite, investment goals and age.




Tax-free and Micro-Investing​
Overview
You may believe that you do not have enough money to invest yet and so you cannot become an investor.​
​
This module will help to undo this myth, and highlight the simple but effective ways that you can start to allow your money to work for you.​
​
You can achieve your investment goals by starting small through tax-free and/or micro-investing.

What is Tax-Free Investing?
With tax-free investment, you don’t pay tax on your investment returns – both while you’re invested and when your investment pays out. The taxes you save remain invested to grow, which can make a big difference in the long-run.​
​
Tax free means:​

No tax on interest or other income​
No dividend tax​
No capital gains tax​

​
This type of investing works especially well if you earn taxable income. You can get tax-free savings products including cash deposits and ETFs through nearly all banks, investment companies and stockbrokers.

Pros and Cons of Tax-Free Investing
Pros​

It grows your savings without any taxation.​
You have unrestricted access to your money. (However, it is recommended to keep your money saved in the account over a long-term horizon so as to fully realize the benefit of compounding your tax-free return.)​
You do not pay any initial fees or exit penalties ​
Choose from a range of funds to suit your investment needs. ​
You have the option of opening a tax-free investment for minor children.


​Cons

Only South African resident individual investors (not trusts, companies, stokvels etc.) are eligible.​
You are only able to contribute a maximum of R33 000 per annum or R500 000 over your lifetime.

What is Micro-Investing?
Micro-investing offers average people a way to profit from the higher returns offered by financial markets in a convenient and low-stress way. You can open accounts with low- or no- minimum-deposit requirements and fractional investing where you can buy, for example R100 of Naspers shares.​
​
The aim of micro-investing platforms is to get rid of traditional hurdles to investing, such as brokerage account fees, so that people are encouraged to invest even if they have limited incomes and assets. By making investing simple and painless, micro-investing platforms can help people who otherwise wouldn’t store up savings for future investment.​
​
Micro-investing is still very young in South Africa and the best way to invest painlessly is tax-free investing. However, there are apps such as Stash or Easy Equities where you can micro-invest.

How Does Micro-Investing Work?
You can micro-invest through easy-to-download apps, depending on what is available for the South African market. These apps normally leverage exchange-traded funds (ETFs).​
​
Most of the platforms offer personalized portfolios based on your risk tolerance, which can be calculated by a series of questions regarding age, life plans and aversion to taking a loss on your investment.​
​
Some apps hook up to your bank accounts and allow them to transfer money on a one-time basis or as a recurring deposit. Other apps automatically invest extra money in the form of spare change, syncing up with your debit or credit cards and taking the difference between the purchase price and the next full rand amount to invest.​
​
All that taken into consideration, micro-investing serves as a gateway to the share market for individuals with little in savings or not much income. For those that remain skeptical of investing, who lack experience or are just starting out, micro-investing serves as a simple way to start setting aside a small amount of money on a regular basis with minimal commitment.
 




​Managing Risk Linked to Investing​
Overview
In this module we will consider some of the factors that influence the supply and demand of shares, and therefore the price of said shares.​
​
Understanding and analyzing these factors can assist you as an investor in managing the risks linked to investing.

Supply and Demand
Share prices react to supply and demand. An increase in demand means an increase in price, unless supply increases to match it. ​
​
If an increase in demand is accompanied by a decrease in supply, the rate of price rise increases. In other words, if more people want to buy a share (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a share than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.​
​The appeal of shares, and ultimately the price of shares, is impacted by supply and demand. Though it might seem like there are other factors at play, such as company earnings or the economy’s health, these are really just drivers of supply and demand.​
​In effect, the market determines what a share is worth regardless of whether you think it is over or undervalued. It’s all about the activity between buyers and sellers.​
​As an investor, it is important to analyze and understand the factors at play that drive supply and demand in order to manage the risk involved in investing. We will now explore some of these factors.
 
Economic Factors
Economic factors including inflation, the financial outlook and changes in interest rate all affect the prices of shares. If inflation and interest rates rise, and the economic outlook is poor, there will usually be a decrease in demand, which will likely result in the share price coming down.​
​The South African share market may also be effected by the health of other economies such as the US. For example: when bad economic news causes a fall in the US share market, the South African market may come under pressure the following day even though it’s US economic data, not South African, due to the strength and reach of the US economy.​
It would prove useful as an investor to consistently monitor news about the economy both locally and globally.
 
Political News
A political development –  within or outside the country – could impact the share price. This factor generally cuts across all the shares on the market. In other words, this is a factor that influences all the shares regardless of the sector classification. The political factor can be noticed through regulatory processes and it eventually influences (not specific) share prices.​
​
Political factors, especially domestic ones, have swift and severe effects on share prices since politics or government determines policies that can benefit or hamper investments. Additionally, there is politics involved in tax decisions, investment promotion, and expansion of export markets. ​
​News from Zimbabwe or other states can influence share prices. Legislation governing the rules under which companies operate, as well as the way they operate can influence share prices. The government may lower the rate of company tax and this may increase share prices because it means a lower tax burden and increased earnings. ​
​Perception factors also contribute to the fluctuation of share prices. South Africa is classified as a developing country, and so the general perceptions that exist towards developing countries will also impact local share prices.​
​Investors can’t ignore political risk, which hinges on changes to legislation. Virtually every company has something to fear or to gain from the government and its regulatory agencies.​
 
Industry Trends
The trends of an industry frequently define share prices because companies operating in the same industry are subject to the same pressures and often perform similarly. ​
​As a result, when an industry is growing, the demand for shares in that particular sector will usually go up, which will then push share prices up. It is also likely that demand for one company’s shares can increase if a competitor is performing poorly.​
 
Market Sentiments
Market sentiment refers to the psychology of market participants, individually and collectively. This is perhaps the most frustrating category because we know it seriously matters, but we are only starting to understand it. ​
​Market sentiment is often subjective, biased, and fixed. For instance, you can make a strong judgment about the future growth prospects of a share, and the future may even substantiate your projections, but in the time being the market may just decide to dwell on a single piece of news that keeps the share unnaturally high or low. And you can occasionally wait for an extended period of time in the hope that other investors will note the fundamentals. 
 
Company News
The share market is ravenous for information and the continuous disclosure requirement for companies ensures a constant flow of news about all aspects of company operations. Investors are also able to gain access to political, economic and scientific news. ​
​Any news that affects company earnings also influences the share price – industrial companies win new contracts; biotechnology companies release the test results for their drugs. All this news has to be weighed and evaluated as to how it will affect the earnings and the return on your shares.​
​The profits of a company are also an issue in share investment. If a company is doing well in terms of its business activities it is likely to attract more investors, which will result in a higher demand of their shares. A company that is not performing well business-wise may result in investors selling their shares on the market. The selling of shares enmasse will lead to more shares flooding the market and therefore bringing the price down – a large quantity of a commodity leads to price decline.
